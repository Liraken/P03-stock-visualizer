with this letter To our shareholders we appreciate your confidence in our company Many of you have held our shares for a long time and that means the world to us To our associates you did such a great job navigating a challenging year Fiscal year 2023 brought new surprises and challenges and as I visited with many of you in our stores clubs distribution and fulfillment centers you handled everything with such a positive attitude We\u2019re impressed and grateful I\u2019ve been with our company for more than 32 years I\u2019ve seen us evolve from being a business that sold mostly general merchandise in the US to creating the most successful store format in retail called the Supercenter to now being the leading omnichannel retailer in the world I\u2019m excited about what we\u2019ll do next Around the world we have great people and a powerful set of assets and capabilities With our combination of stores Sam\u2019s Clubs and eCommerce capabilities we\u2019re positioned to serve people however they want to shop They can come see us in a store or club or use their mobile device to order from an increasingly broad assortment They can save money and time with us however they choose to in that moment Our ability to serve people how they want to be served has enabled us to add 156 billion in revenue in the last five years and 125 billion in the last three years reflecting a compounded annual growth rate of 6 percent and 8 percent respectively Our results from last year included sales growth of 9 percent in our retained markets outside the US and comp sales of 105 percent in Sam\u2019s Club US and 66 percent in Walmart US That reflects doubledigit comps at Sam\u2019s Club US for the third consecutive year record membership counts and a growing popularity with Gen Z members Globally our eCommerce sales have reached 82 billion and now make up 14 percent of our total sales We ended the year with inventory in good shape despite the challenges earlier in the year I\u2019ve been asked lately \u201cHow do you describe the company today given how much we\u2019ve changed\u201d We describe today\u2019s Walmart as a peopleled techpowered omnichannel retailer dedicated to helping people save money and live better We work to bring the purpose Sam Walton described in 1992 to life for those we have the privilege to serve We know who we are We like who we are And we like who we\u2019re becoming I wouldn\u2019t trade what we have with anyone Let\u2019s break down the description of today\u2019s Walmart I\u2019ll start with our people because it\u2019s our 21 million associates that make the difference They make it all happen Our job is to create opportunities for them to fulfill their potential and to make sure every one of them feels like they belong at Walmart We provide a ladder of opportunity We\u2019re constantly changing to create the right level of investments in wages and benefits including healthcare opportunities to save through a 401k our Walmart stock ownership plan and our investments in educational opportunities with our own academies and Live Better U In the US about 75 percent of salaried store club and supply chain managers started their careers as hourly associates Healthcare coverage for a US associate starts at 33 per pay period We provide up to 20000 in support for adoption or surrogacy and a birth mom can receive up to 22 weeks of paid leave In addition to our own internal academies Live Better U lets associates choose from 75 programs across 25 education providers where they can develop skills in areas like business management and data analytics We\u2019ve seen 105000 associates use these programs since 2018 and we estimate they\u2019ve saved about 333 million in tuition costs More than ever we\u2019re being powered by technology Our customers and members engage through our apps and sites and our associates have information and capabilities at their fingertips We\u2019re learning to put our data to work We\u2019ve modernized our tech stack and we\u2019re building and scaling new applications like a virtual fitting room and Scan  Go We\u2019ve built a conversational AI platform enabling voice and chat capabilities that\u2019s being used by more than 50 million customers across many of our markets Our associates used our Ask Sam application to answer 13 billion questions last year to help them do things like find an item check a modular or see who is working in a particular area that day When we bring our people and our tech together to serve customers and members we create a true omnichannel experience There isn\u2019t another retailer with over 10500 stores Sam\u2019s Clubs and a scaled eCommerce business For the first time I know of our reputation for convenience has risen to nearly the same level as our strong reputation for price This is an exciting development During a recent investor conference we shared our focus on growth as well as improved operating margin and return on investment We can deliver value with everyday low prices for customers and members and improve our profitability and returns through productivity improvements and a new mix of businesses including a growing marketplace and advertising We\u2019re dedicated to helping people save money and live better Everyone understands what we mean when we say save money but what does it mean to help people live better This part of our strategy includes saving people time helping them improve their health providing tools to save on financial transactions and strengthening their communities and the planet We have an aspiration to become a regenerative company Being regenerative means restoring renewing and replenishing Based on our latest estimates we are now diverting 78 percent of our waste from landfills and 46 percent of our energy is provided by renewables And we\u2019re now threequarters of the way toward our Project Gigaton goal to reduce or avoid one billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 Incredible A huge thank you to our merchants and our participating suppliers It\u2019s an exciting time to be at Walmart We\u2019re at an important strategic and financial inflection point Our strategy is simple It\u2019s to bring our purpose to life The business we\u2019re building positions us to earn trust and build an even stronger

Amazon Despite 2022 being one of the harder macroeconomic years in recent memory and with some of our own operating challenges to boot we still found a way to grow demand on top of the unprecedented growth we experienced in the first half of the pandemic We innovated in our largest businesses to meaningfully improve customer experience short and long term And we made important adjustments in our investment decisions and the way in which we\u2019ll invent moving forward while still preserving the longterm investments that we believe can change the future of Amazon for customers shareholders and employees While there were an unusual number of simultaneous challenges this past year the reality is that if you operate in large dynamic global market segments with many capable and wellfunded competitors the conditions in which Amazon operates all of its businesses conditions rarely stay stagnant for long In the 25 years I\u2019ve been at Amazon there has been constant change much of which we\u2019ve initiated ourselves WhenIjoined Amazon in 1997 we had booked 15M in revenue in 1996 were a booksonly retailer did not have a thirdparty marketplace and only shipped to addresses in the US Today Amazon sells nearly every physical and digital retail item you can imagine with a vibrant thirdparty seller ecosystem that accounts for 60 of our unit sales and reaches customers in virtually every country around the world Similarly building a business around a set of technology infrastructure services in the cloud was not obvious in 2003 when westarted pursuing AWS and still wasn\u2019t when we launched our first services in 2006 Having virtually every book at your fingertips in 60 seconds and then being able to store and retrieve them on a lightweight digital reader was not \u201ca thing\u201d yet when we launched Kindle in 2007 nor was a voicedriven personal assistant like Alexa launched in 2014 that you could use to access entertainment control your smart home shop and retrieve all sorts of information There have also been times when macroeconomic conditions or operating inefficiencies have presented us with new challenges For instance in the 2001 dotcom crash we had to secure letters of credit to buy inventory for the holidays streamline costs to deliver better profitability for the business yet still prioritized the longterm customer experience and business we were trying to build if you remember we actually lowered prices in most of our categories during that tenuous 2001 period You saw this sort of balancing again in 20082009 as we endured the recession provoked by the mortgagebacked securities financial crisis Wetook several actions to manage the cost structure and efficiency of our Stores business but we also balanced this streamlining with investment in customer experiences that we believed could be substantial future businesses with strong returns for shareholders In 2008 AWS was still a fairly small fledgling business We knew we were onto something but it still required substantial capital investment There were voices inside and outside of the company questioning why Amazon known mostly as an online retailer then would be investing so much in cloud computing But we knew we were inventing something special that could create a lot of value for customers and Amazon in the future We had a head start on potential competitors and if anything we wanted to accelerate our pace of innovation We made the longterm decision to continue investing in AWS Fifteen years later AWS is now an 85B annual revenue run rate business with strong profitability that has transformed how customers from startups to multinational companies to public sector organizations manage their technology infrastructure Amazon would be a different company if we\u2019d slowed investment in AWS during that 20082009 period Change is always around the corner Sometimes you proactively invite it in and sometimes it just comes aknocking But when you see it\u2019s coming you have to embrace it And the companies that do this well over a long period of time usually succeed I\u2019m optimistic about our future prospects because I like the way our team is responding to the changes we see in front of us Over the last several months we took a deep look across the company business by business invention by invention and asked ourselves whether we had conviction about each initiative\u2019s longterm potential to drive enough revenue operating income free cash flow and return on invested capital In some cases it led to us shuttering certain businesses For instance we stopped pursuing physical store concepts like our Bookstores and 4 Star stores closed our Amazon Fabric and Amazon Care efforts and moved on from some newer devices where we didn\u2019t see a path to meaningful returns In other cases we looked at some programs that weren\u2019t producing the returns we\u2019d hoped eg free shipping for all online grocery orders over 35 and amended them We also reprioritized where to spend our resources which ultimately led to the hard decision to eliminate 27000 corporate roles There are a number of other changes that we\u2019ve made over the last several months to streamline our overall costs and like most leadership teams we\u2019ll continue to evaluate what we\u2019re seeing in our business and proceed adaptively We also looked hard at how we were working together as a team and asked our corporate employees to come back to the office at least three days a week beginning in May During the pandemic our employees rallied to get work done from home and did everything possible to keep up with the unexpected circumstances that presented themselves It was impressive and I\u2019m proud of the way our collective team came together to overcome unprecedented challenges for our customers communities and business But we don\u2019t think it\u2019s the best longterm approach We\u2019ve become convinced that collaborating and inventing is easier and more effective when we\u2019re working together and learning from one another in person The energy and riffing on oneanother\u2019s ideas happen more freely and many of the best Amazon inventions have had their breakthrough moments from people staying behind after a meeting and working through ideas on a whiteboard or continuing the conversation on the walk back from a meeting or just popping by a teammate\u2019s office later that day with another thought Invention is often messy It wanders and meanders and marinates Serendipitous interactions help it and there are more of those inperson than virtually It\u2019s also significantly easier to learn model practice and strengthen our culture when we\u2019re in the office together most of the time and surrounded by our colleagues Innovation and our unique culture have been incredibly important in our first 29 years as a company and I expect it will be comparably so in the next 29 A critical challenge we\u2019ve continued to tackle is the rising cost to serve in our Stores fulfillment network ie the cost to get a product from Amazon to a customer\u2014and we\u2019ve made several changes that we believe will meaningfully improve our fulfillment costs and speed of delivery During the early part of the pandemic with many physical stores shut down our consumer business grew at anextraordinary clip with annual revenue increasing from 245B in 2019 to 434B in 2022 This meant that we had to double the fulfillment center footprint that we\u2019d built over the prior 25 years and substantially accelerate building a lastmile transportation network that\u2019s now the size of UPS along with a new sortation center network to assist with efficiency and speed when items needed to traverse long distances\u2014all in the span of about twoyears This was no easy feat and hundreds of thousands of Amazonians worked very hard to make this happen However not surprisingly with that rate and scale of change there was a lot of optimization needed to yield the intended productivity Over the last several months we\u2019ve scrutinized every process path in our fulfillment centers and transportation network and redesigned scores of processes and mechanisms resulting in steady productivity gains and cost reductions over the last few quarters There\u2019s more work to do but we\u2019re pleased with our trajectory and the meaningful upside in front of us Wealso took this occasion to make larger structural changes that set us up better to deliver lower costs and faster speed for many years to come A good example was reevaluating how our US fulfillment network was organized Until recently Amazon operated one national US fulfillment network that distributed inventory from fulfillment centers spread across the entire country If a local fulfillment center didn\u2019t have the product a customer ordered we\u2019d end up shipping it from other parts of the country costing us more and increasing delivery times This challenge became more pronounced as our fulfillment network expanded to hundreds of additional nodes over the last few years distributing inventory across more locations and increasing the complexity of connecting the fulfillment center and delivery station nodes efficiently Last year we started rearchitecting our inventory placement strategy and leveraging our larger fulfillment center footprint to move from a national fulfillment network to a regionalized network model We made significant internal changes eg placement and logistics software processes physical operations to create eight interconnected regions in smaller geographic areas Each of these regions has broad relevant selection to operate in a largely self sufficient way while still being able to ship nationally when necessary Some of the most meaningful and hard work came from optimizing the connections between this large amount of infrastructure We also continue to improve our advanced machine learning algorithms to better predict what customers in various parts of the country will need so that we have the right inventory in the right regions at the right time We\u2019ve recently completed this regional roll out and like the early results Shorter travel distances mean lower cost to serve less impact on the environment and customers getting their orders faster On the latter we\u2019re excited about seeing more next day and sameday deliveries and we\u2019re on track to have our fastest Prime delivery speeds ever in 2023 Overall we remain confident about our plans to lower costs reduce delivery times and build a meaningfully larger retail business with healthy operating margins AWS has an 85B annualized revenue run rate is still early in its adoption curve but at a juncture where it\u2019s critical to stay focused on what matters most to customers over the longhaul Despite growing 29 yearover year \u201cYoY\u201d in 2022 on a 62B revenue base AWS faces shortterm headwinds right now as companies are being more cautious in spending given the challenging current macroeconomic conditions While some companies might obsess over how they could extract as much money from customers as possible in these tight times it\u2019s neither what customers want nor best for customers in the long term so we\u2019re taking a different tack One of the many advantages of AWS and cloud computing is that when your business grows you can seamlessly scale up and conversely if your business contracts you can choose to give us back that capacity and cease paying for it This elasticity is unique to the cloud and doesn\u2019t exist when you\u2019ve already made expensive capital investments in your own onpremises datacenters servers and networking gear In AWS like all our businesses we\u2019re not trying to optimize for any one quarter or year We\u2019re trying to build customer relationships and a business that outlast all of us and as a result our AWS sales and support teams are spending much of their time helping customers optimize their AWS spend so they can better weather this uncertain economy Many of these AWS customers tell us that they\u2019re not costcutting as much as cost optimizing so they can take their resources and apply them to emerging and inventive new customer experiences they\u2019re planning Customers have appreciated this customerfocused longterm approach and we think it\u2019ll bode well for both customers and AWS While these shortterm headwinds soften our growth rate we like a lot of the fundamentals that we\u2019re seeing in AWS Our new customer pipeline is robust as are our active migrations Many companies use discontinuous periods like this to step back and determine what they strategically want to change and we find an increasing number of enterprises opting out of managing their own infrastructure and preferring to move to AWS to enjoy the agility innovation costefficiency and security benefits And most importantly for customers AWS continues to deliver new capabilities rapidly over 3300 new features and services launched in 2022 and invest in longterm inventions that change what\u2019s possible Chip development is a good example In last year\u2019s letter I mentioned the investment we were making in our generalpurpose CPU processors named Graviton Graviton2based compute instances deliver up to 40 better priceperformance than the comparable latest generation x86based instances and in 2022 we delivered our Graviton3 chips providing 25 better performance than the Graviton2 processors Further as machine learning adoption has continued to accelerate customers have yearned for lowercost GPUs the chips most commonly used for machine learning AWS started investing years ago in these specialized chips for machine learning training and inference inferences are the predictions or answers that a machine learning model provides We delivered our first training chip in 2022 \u201cTrainium\u201d and for the most common machine learning models Trainiumbased instances are up to 140 faster than GPUbased instances at up to 70lower cost Most companies are still in the training stage but as they develop models that graduate to largescale production they\u2019ll find that most of the cost is in inference because models are trained periodically whereas inferences are happening all the time as their associated application is being exercised We launched our first inference chips \u201cInferentia\u201d in 2019 and they have saved companies like Amazon over a hundred million dollars in capital expense already Our Inferentia2 chip which just launched offers up to four times higher throughput and ten times lower latency than our first Inferentia processor With the enormous upcoming growth in machine learning customers will be able to get a lot more done with AWS\u2019s training and inference chips at a significantly lower cost We\u2019re not close to being done innovating here and this longterm investment should prove fruitful for both customers and AWS AWS is still in the early stages of its evolution and has a chance for unusual growth in the next decade Similarly high potential Amazon\u2019s Advertising business is uniquely effective for brands which is part of why it continues to grow at a brisk clip Akin to physical retailers\u2019 advertising businesses selling shelf space end caps and placement in their circulars our sponsored products and brands offerings have been an integral part of the Amazon shopping experience for more than a decade However unlike physical retailers Amazon can tailor these sponsored products to be relevant to what customers are searching for given what we know about shopping behaviors and our very deep investment in machine learning algorithms This leads to advertising that\u2019s more useful for customers and as a result performs better for brands This is part of why our Advertising revenue has continued to grow rapidly 23 YoY in Q4 2022 25 YoY overall for 2022 on a 31B revenue base even as most large advertisingfocused businesses\u2019 growth have slowed over the last several quarters We strive to be the best place for advertisers to build their brands We have near and longterm opportunities that will help us achieve that mission We\u2019re continuing to make large investments in machine learning to keep honing our advertising selection algorithms For the past couple of years we\u2019ve invested in building comprehensive flexible and durable planning and measurement solutions giving marketers greater insight into advertising effectiveness An example is Amazon Marketing Cloud \u201cAMC\u201d AMC is a \u201cclean room\u201d ie secure digital environment in which advertisers can run custom audience and campaign analytics across a range of first and thirdparty inputs in a privacysafe manner to generate advertising and business insights to inform their broader marketing and sales strategies The Advertising and AWS teams have collaborated to enable companies to store their data in AWS operate securely in AMC with Amazon and other thirdparty data sources perform analytics in AWS and have the option to activate advertising on Amazon or thirdparty publishers through the Amazon DemandSide Platform Customers really like this concerted capability We also see future opportunity to thoughtfully integrate advertising into our video live sports audio and grocery products We\u2019ll continue to work hard to help brands uniquely engage with the right audience and grow this part of our business While it\u2019s tempting in turbulent times only to focus on your existing large businesses to build a sustainable longlasting growing company that helps customers across a large number of dimensions you can\u2019t stop inventing and working on longterm customer experiences that can meaningfully impact customers and your company Whenwelook at new investment opportunities we ask ourselves a few questions \u25e6 If wewere successful could it be big and have a reasonable return on invested capital \u25e6 Is the opportunity being wellserved today \u25e6 Do we have a differentiated approach \u25e6 And do we have competence in that area And if not can we acquire it quickly If we like the answers to those questions then we\u2019ll invest This process has led to some expansions that seem straightforward and others that some folks might not have initially guessed The earliest example is when we chose to expand from just selling Books to adding categories like Music Video Electronics and Toys Back then 19981999 it wasn\u2019t universally applauded but in retrospect it seems fairly obvious The same could be said for our international Stores expansion In 2022 our international consumer segment drove 118B of revenue In our larger established international consumer businesses we\u2019re big enough to be impacted by the slowing macroeconomic conditions however the growth in 20192021 on a large base was remarkable\u201430 compound annual growth rate \u201cCAGR\u201d in the UK 26 in Germany and 21 in Japan excluding the impact of FX Over the past several years we\u2019ve invested in new international geographies including India Brazil Mexico Australia various European countries the Middle East and parts of Africa These new countries take a certain amount of fixed investment to get started and to scale but we like the trajectory they\u2019re on and their growth patterns resemble what we\u2019ve seen in North America and our established international geographies Emerging countries sometimes lack some of the infrastructure and services that our business relies on eg payment methods transportation services and internet telecom infrastructure To solve these challenges we continue to work with various partners to deliver solutions for customers Ultimately we believe that this investment in serving a broader geographical footprint will allow us to help more customers across the world as well as build a larger free cash flowgenerating consumer business Beyond geographic expansion we\u2019ve been working to expand our customer offerings across some large unique product retail market segments Grocery is an 800B market segment in the US alone with the average household shopping three to four times per week Amazon has built a somewhat unusual but significant grocery business over nearly 20 years Similar to how other mass merchants entered the grocery space in the 1980s we began by adding products typically found in supermarket aisles that don\u2019t require temperature control such as paper products canned and boxed food candy and snacks pet care health and personal care and beauty However we offer more than three million items compared to a typical supermarket\u2019s 30K for the same categories To date we\u2019ve also focused on larger pack sizes given the current cost to serve online delivery While we\u2019re pleased with the size and growth of our grocery business we aspire to serve more of our customers\u2019grocery needs than we do todayTo do so we need a broader physical store footprint given that most of the grocery shopping still happens in physical venues Whole Foods Market pioneered the natural and organic specialty grocery store concept 40 years agoToday it\u2019s a large and growing business that continues to raise the bar for healthy and sustainable food Over the past year we\u2019ve continued to invest in the business while also making changes to drive better profitability Whole Foods is on an encouraging path but to have a larger impact on physical grocery we must find a mass grocery format that we believe is worth expanding broadly Amazon Fresh is the brand we\u2019ve been experimenting with for a few years and we\u2019re working hard to identify and build the right mass grocery format for Amazon scale Grocery is a big growth opportunity for Amazon Amazon Business is another example of an investment where our ecommerce and logistics capabilities position us well to pursue this large market segment Amazon Business allows businesses municipalities and organizations to procure products like office supplies and other bulk items easily and at great savings While some areas of the economy have struggled over the past few years Amazon Business has thrived Why Because the team has translated what it means to deliver selection value and convenience into a business procurement setting constantly listening to and learning from customers and innovating on their behalf Some people have never heard of Amazon Business but our business customers love it Amazon Business launched in 2015 and today drives roughly 35B in annualized gross sales More than six million active customers including 96 of the global Fortune 100 companies are enjoying Amazon Business\u2019 onestop shopping realtime analytics and broad selection on hundreds of millions of business supplies We believe that we\u2019ve only scratched the surface of what\u2019s possible to date and plan to keep building the features our business customers tell us they need and want While many brands and merchants successfully sell their products on Amazon\u2019s marketplace there are also a large number of brands and sellers who have launched their own directtoconsumer websites One of the challenges for these merchants is driving conversion from views to purchases We invented Buy with Prime to help with this challenge Buy with Prime allows thirdparty brands and sellers to offer their products on their own websites to our large Amazon Prime membershipand offer those customers fast free Prime shipping and seamless checkout with their Amazon account Buy with Prime provides merchants several additional benefits including Amazon handling the product storage picking packing delivery payment and any returns all through Amazon Pay and Fulfillment by Amazon Buy with Prime has recently been made available to all US merchants and so far Buy with Prime has increased shopper conversion on thirdparty shopping sites by 25 on average Merchants are excited about converting more sales and fulfilling these shipments more easily Prime members love that they can use their Prime benefits on more destinations and Buy with Prime allows us to improve the shopping experience across more of the web Expanding internationally pursuing large retail market segments that are still nascent for Amazon and using our unique assets to help merchants sell more effectively on their own websites are somewhat natural extensions for us There are also a few investments we\u2019re making that are further from our core businesses but where we see unique opportunity In 2003 AWS would have been a classic example In 2023 Amazon Healthcare and Kuiper are potential analogues Ourinitial efforts in Healthcare began with pharmacy which felt less like a major departure from ecommerce For years Amazon customers had asked us when we\u2019d offer them an online pharmacy as their frustrations mounted with current providers Launched in 2020 AmazonPharmacyisafullservice online pharmacythat offers transparent pricing easy refills and savings for Prime members The business is growing quickly and continues to innovate An example is Amazon Pharmacy\u2019s recent launch of RxPass which for a 5 per month flat fee enables Prime members to get as many of the eligible prescription medications as they need for dozens of common conditions like high blood pressure acid reflux and anxiety However our customers have continued to express a strong desire for Amazon to provide a better alternative to the inefficient and unsatisfying broader healthcare experience We decided to start with primary care as it\u2019s a prevalent first stop in the patient journey We evaluated and studied the existing landscape extensively including some early Amazon experiments like Amazon Care During this process we identified One Medical\u2019s patientfocused experience as an excellent foundation upon which to build our future business and in July 2022 we announced our acquisition of One Medical There are several elements that customers love about One Medical It has a fantastic digital app that makes it easy for patients to discuss issues with a medical practitioner via chat or video conference If a physical visit is required One Medical has offices in cities across the US where patients can book same or next day appointments One Medical has relationships with specialty physicians in each of its cities and works closely with local hospital systems to make seeing specialists easy so One Medical members can quickly access these resources when needed Going forward we strongly believe that One Medical and Amazon will continue to innovate together to change what primary care will look like for customers Kuiper is another example of Amazon innovating for customers over the long term in an area where there\u2019s high customer need Our vision for Kuiper is to create a lowEarth orbit satellite system to deliver highquality broadband internet service to places around the world that don\u2019t currently have it There are hundreds of millions of households and businesses who don\u2019t have reliable access to the internet Imagine what they\u2019ll be able to do with reliable connectivity from people taking online education courses using financial services starting their own businesses doing their shopping enjoying entertainment to businesses and governments improving their coverage efficiency and operations Kuiper will deliver not only accessibility but affordability Our teams have developed lowcost antennas ie customer terminals that will lower the barriers to access We recently unveiled the new terminals that will communicate with the satellites passing overhead and we expect to be able to produce our standard residential version for less than400 eachThey\u2019re small 11 inches square 1 inch thick and weigh less than 5 pounds without their mounting bracket but they deliver speeds up to 400 megabits per second And they\u2019re powered by Amazondesigned baseband chips We\u2019re preparing to launch two prototype satellites to test the entire endtoend communications network this year and plan to be in beta with commercial customers in 2024 The customer reaction to what we\u2019ve shared thus far about Kuiper has been very positive and we believe Kuiper represents a very large potential opportunity for Amazon It also shares several similarities to AWS in that it\u2019s capital intensive at the start but has a large prospective consumer enterprise and government customer base significant revenue and operating profit potential and relatively few companies with the technical and inventive aptitude as well as the investment hypothesis to go after it One final investment area that I\u2019ll mention that\u2019s core to setting Amazon up to invent in every area of our business for many decades to come and where we\u2019re investing heavily is Large Language Models \u201cLLMs\u201d and Generative AI Machine learning has been a technology with high promise for several decades but it\u2019s only been the last five to ten years that it\u2019s started to be used more pervasively by companies This shift was driven byseveral factors including access to higher volumes of computecapacity at lowerprices thanwasever available Amazon has been using machine learning extensively for 25 years employing it in everything from personalized ecommerce recommendations to fulfillment center pick paths to drones for Prime Air to Alexa to the many machine learning services AWS offers where AWS has the broadest machine learning functionality and customer base of any cloud provider More recently a newer form of machine learning called Generative AI has burst onto the scene and promises to significantly accelerate machine learning adoption Generative AI is based on very Large Language Models trained on up to hundreds of billions of parameters and growing across expansive datasets and has radically general and broad recall and learning capabilities We have been working on our own LLMs for a while now believe it will transform and improve virtually every customer experience and will continue to invest substantially in these models across all of our consumer seller brand and creator experiences Additionally as we\u2019ve done for years in AWS we\u2019re democratizing this technology so companies of all sizes can leverage Generative AI AWS is offering the most priceperformant machine learning chips in Trainium and Inferentia so small and large companies can afford to train and run their LLMs in production We enable companies to choose from various LLMs and build applications with all of the AWS security privacy and other features that customers are accustomed to using And we\u2019re delivering applications like AWS\u2019s CodeWhisperer which revolutionizes developer productivity by generating code suggestions in real time I could write an entire letter on LLMs and Generative AI as I think they will be that transformative but I\u2019ll leave that for a future letter Let\u2019s just say that LLMs and Generative AI are going to be a big deal for customers our shareholders and Amazon So in closing I\u2019m optimistic that we\u2019ll emerge from this challenging macroeconomic time in a stronger position than when we entered it There are several reasons for it and I\u2019ve mentioned many of them above But there are two relatively simple statistics that underline our immense future opportunity While we have a consumer business that\u2019s 434B in 2022 the vast majority of total market segment share in global retail still resides in physical stores roughly 80 And it\u2019s a similar story for Global IT spending where we have AWSrevenue of 80B in 2022 with about 90 of Global IT spending still onpremises and yet to migrate to the cloud As these equations steadily flip\u2014as we\u2019re already seeing happen\u2014we believe our leading customer experiences relentless invention customer focus and hard work will result in significant growth in the coming years And of course this doesn\u2019t include the other businesses and experiences we\u2019re pursuing at Amazon all of which are still in their early days I strongly believe that our best days are in front of us and I look forward to working with my teammates at Amazon to make it so

savings of a great number of individuals We are grateful for their enduring trust a relationship that often spans much of their adult lifetime It is those dedicated savers that are forefront in my mind as I write this letter A common belief is that people choose to save when young expecting thereby to maintain their living standards after retirement Any assets that remain at death this theory says will usually be left to their families or possibly to friends and philanthropy Our experience has differed We believe Berkshire\u2019s individual holders largely to be of the onceasaver alwaysasaver variety Though these people live well they eventually dispense most of their funds to philanthropic organizations These in turn redistribute the funds by expenditures intended to improve the lives of a great many people who are unrelated to the original benefactor Sometimes the results have been spectacular The disposition of money unmasks humans Charlie and I watch with pleasure the vast flow of Berkshiregenerated funds to public needs and alongside the infrequency with which our shareholders opt for lookatme assets and dynastybuilding Whowouldn\u2019t enjoy working for shareholders like ours What WeDo Charlie and I allocate your savings at Berkshire between two related forms of ownership First we invest in businesses that we control usually buying 100 of each Berkshire directs capital allocation at these subsidiaries and selects the CEOs who make daybyday operating decisions When large enterprises are being managed both trust and rules are essential Berkshire emphasizes the former to an unusual\u2013 some would say extreme\u2013 degree Disappointments are inevitable We are understanding about business mistakes our tolerance for personal misconduct is zero In our second category of ownership we buy publiclytraded stocks through which we passively own pieces of businesses Holding these investments we have no say in management 3 Our goal in both forms of ownership is to make meaningful investments in businesses with both longlasting favorable economic characteristics and trustworthy managers Please note particularly that we own publiclytraded stocks based on our expectations about their longterm business performance not because we view them as vehicles for adroit purchases and sales That point is crucial Charlie and I are not stockpickers we are businesspickers Over the years I have made many mistakes Consequently our extensive collection of businesses currently consists of a few enterprises that have truly extraordinary economics many that enjoy very good economic characteristics and a large group that are marginal Along the way other businesses in which I have invested have died their products unwanted by the public Capitalism has two sides The system creates an evergrowing pile of losers while concurrently delivering a gusher of improved goods and services Schumpeter called this phenomenon \u201ccreative destruction\u201d One advantage of our publiclytraded segment is that\u2013 episodically\u2013 it becomes easy to buy pieces of wonderful businesses at wonderful prices It\u2019s crucial to understand that stocks often trade at truly foolish prices both high and low \u201cEfficient\u201d markets exist only in textbooks In truth marketable stocks and bonds are baffling their behavior usually understandable only in retrospect Controlled businesses are a different breed They sometimes command ridiculously higher prices than justified but are almost never available at bargain valuations Unless under duress the owner of a controlled business gives no thought to selling at a panictype valuation  At this point a report card from me is appropriate In 58 years of Berkshire management most of my capitalallocation decisions have been no better than soso In some cases also bad moves by me have been rescued by very large doses of luck Remember our escapes from neardisasters at USAir and Salomon I certainly do Our satisfactory results have been the product of about a dozen truly good decisions\u2013 that would be about one every five years\u2013 and a sometimesforgotten advantage that favors longterm investors such as Berkshire Let\u2019s take a peek behind the curtain The Secret Sauce In August 1994\u2013 yes 1994\u2013 Berkshire completed its sevenyear purchase of the 400 million shares of CocaCola we now own The total cost was 13 billion\u2013 then a very meaningful sumatBerkshire The cash dividend we received from Coke in 1994 was 75 million By 2022 the dividend had increased to 704 million Growth occurred every year just as certain as birthdays All Charlie and I were required to do was cash Coke\u2019s quarterly dividend checks We expect that those checks arehighlylikelytogrow 4 American Express is much the same story Berkshire\u2019s purchases of Amex were essentially completed in 1995 and coincidentally also cost 13 billion Annual dividends received from this investment have grown from 41 million to 302 million Those checks too seem highly likely to increase These dividend gains though pleasing are far from spectacular But they bring with them important gains in stock prices At yearend our Coke investment was valued at 25 billion while Amex was recorded at 22 billion Each holding now accounts for roughly 5 of Berkshire\u2019s net worth akin to its weighting long ago Assume for a moment I had made a similarlysized investment mistake in the 1990s one that flatlined and simply retained its 13 billion value in 2022 An example would be a highgrade 30year bond That disappointing investment would now represent an insignificant 03 of Berkshire\u2019s net worth and would be delivering to us an unchanged 80 million or so of annual income The lesson for investors The weeds wither away in significance as the flowers bloom Over time it takes just a few winners to work wonders And yes it helps to start early and live into your 90s as well The Past Year in Brief Berkshire had a good year in 2022 The company\u2019s operating earnings\u2013 our term for income calculated using Generally Accepted Accounting Principles \u201cGAAP\u201d exclusive of capital gains or losses from equity holdings\u2013 set a record at 308 billion Charlie and I focus on this operational figure and urge you to do so as well The GAAP figure absent our adjustment fluctuates wildly and capriciously at every reporting date Note its acrobatic behavior in 2022 which is in no way unusual Earnings in  billions 2022 Quarter 1 2 3 4 \u201cOperating Earnings\u201d 70 93 78 67 GAAPEarnings We are Required to Report 55 438 27 182 The GAAP earnings are 100 misleading when viewed quarterly or even annually Capital gains to be sure have been hugely important to Berkshire over past decades and we expect them to be meaningfully positive in future decades But their quarterbyquarter gyrations regularly and mindlessly headlined by media totally misinform investors 5 A second positive development for Berkshire last year was our purchase of Alleghany Corporation a propertycasualty insurer captained by Joe Brandon I\u2019ve worked with Joe in the past and he understands both Berkshire and insurance Alleghany delivers special value to us because Berkshire\u2019s unmatched financial strength allows its insurance subsidiaries to follow valuable and enduring investment strategies unavailable to virtually all competitors Aided by Alleghany our insurance float increased during 2022 from 147 billion to 164 billion With disciplined underwriting these funds have a decent chance of being costfree over time Since purchasing our first propertycasualty insurer in 1967 Berkshire\u2019s float has increased 8000fold through acquisitions operations and innovations Though not recognized in our financial statements this float has been an extraordinary asset for Berkshire New shareholders can get an understanding of its value by reading our annually updated explanation of float on page A2  A very minor gain in pershare intrinsic value took place in 2022 through Berkshire share repurchases as well as similar moves at Apple and American Express both significant investees of ours At Berkshire we directly increased your interest in our unique collection of businesses by repurchasing 12 of the company\u2019s outstanding shares At Apple and Amex repurchases increased Berkshire\u2019s ownership a bit without any cost to us The math isn\u2019t complicated When the share count goes down your interest in our many businesses goes up Every small bit helps if repurchases are made at valueaccretive prices Just as surely when a company overpays for repurchases the continuing shareholders lose At such times gains flow only to the selling shareholders and to the friendly but expensive investment banker who recommended the foolish purchases Gains from valueaccretive repurchases it should be emphasized benefit all owners\u2013 in every respect Imagine if you will three fullyinformed shareholders of a local auto dealership one of whom manages the business Imagine further that one of the passive owners wishes to sell his interest back to the company at a price attractive to the two continuing shareholders When completed has this transaction harmed anyone Is the manager somehow favored over the continuing passive owners Has the public been hurt When you are told that all repurchases are harmful to shareholders or to the country or particularly beneficial to CEOs you are listening to either an economic illiterate or a silvertongued demagogue characters that are not mutually exclusive 6 Almost endless details of Berkshire\u2019s 2022 operations are laid out on pages K33\u2013 K66 Charlie and I along with many Berkshire shareholders enjoy poring over the many facts and figures laid out in that section These pages are not however required reading There are many Berkshire centimillionaires and yes billionaires who have never studied our financial figures They simply know that Charlie and I\u2013 along with our families and close friends\u2013 continue to have very significant investments in Berkshire and they trust us to treat their money as we do our own And that is a promise we can make  Finally an important warning Even the operating earnings figure that we favor can easily be manipulated by managers who wish to do so Such tampering is often thought of as sophisticated by CEOs directors and their advisors Reporters and analysts embrace its existence as well Beating \u201cexpectations\u201d is heralded as a managerial triumph That activity is disgusting It requires no talent to manipulate numbers Only a deep desire to deceive is required \u201cBold imaginative accounting\u201d as a CEO once described his deception to me has become one of the shames of capitalism 58 Years\u2013 and a Few Figures In 1965 Berkshire was a onetrick pony the owner of a venerable\u2013 but doomed\u2013 New England textile operation With that business on a death march Berkshire needed an immediate fresh start Looking back I was slow to recognize the severity of its problems And then came a stroke of good luck National Indemnity became available in 1967 and we shifted our resources toward insurance and other nontextile operations Thus began our journey to 2023 a bumpy road involving a combination of continuous savings by our owners that is by their retaining earnings the power of compounding our avoidance of major mistakes and\u2013 most important of all\u2013 the American Tailwind America would have done fine without Berkshire The reverse is not true Berkshire now enjoys major ownership in an unmatched collection of huge and diversified businesses Let\u2019s first look at the 5000 or so publiclyheld companies that trade daily on NASDAQ the NYSE and related venues Within this group is housed the members of the SP 500 Index an elite collection of large and wellknown American companies In aggregate the 500 earned 18 trillion in 2021 I don\u2019t yet have the final results for 2022 Using therefore the 2021 figures only 128 of the 500 including Berkshire itself earned 3 billion or more Indeed 23 lost money 7 At yearend 2022 Berkshire was the largest owner of eight of these giants American Express Bank of America Chevron CocaCola HP Inc Moody\u2019s Occidental Petroleum and Paramount Global In addition to those eight investees Berkshire owns 100 of BNSF and 92 of BH Energy each with earnings that exceed the 3 billion mark noted above 59 billion at BNSF and 43 billion at BHE Were these companies publiclyowned they would replace two present members of the 500 All told our ten controlled and noncontrolled behemoths leave Berkshire more broadly aligned with the country\u2019s economic future than is the case at any other US company This calculation leaves aside \u201cfiduciary\u201d operations such as pension funds and investment companies In addition Berkshire\u2019s insurance operation though conducted through many individuallymanaged subsidiaries has a value comparable to BNSF or BHE As for the future Berkshire will always hold a boatload of cash and US Treasury bills along with a wide array of businesses We will also avoid behavior that could result in any uncomfortable cash needs at inconvenient times including financial panics and unprecedented insurance losses Our CEO will always be the Chief Risk Officer\u2013 a task it is irresponsible to delegate Additionally our future CEOs will have a significant part of their net worth in Berkshire shares bought with their own money And yes our shareholders will continue to save and prosper by retaining earnings At Berkshire there will be no finish line Some Surprising Facts About Federal Taxes During the decade ending in 2021 the United States Treasury received about 323 trillion in taxes while it spent 439 trillion Though economists politicians and many of the public have opinions about the consequences of that huge imbalance Charlie and I plead ignorance and firmly believe that nearterm economic and market forecasts are worse than useless Our job is to manage Berkshire\u2019s operations and finances in a manner that will achieve an acceptable result over time and that will preserve the company\u2019s unmatched staying power when financial panics or severe worldwide recessions occur Berkshire also offers some modest protection from runaway inflation but this attribute is far from perfect Huge and entrenched fiscal deficits have consequences The 32 trillion of revenue was garnered by the Treasury through individual income taxes 48 social security and related receipts 341\u20442 corporate income tax payments 81\u20442 and a wide variety of lesser levies Berkshire\u2019s contribution via the corporate income tax was 32 billion during the decade almost exactly a tenth of 1 of all money that the Treasury collected 8 And that means\u2013 brace yourself\u2013 had there been roughly 1000 taxpayers in the US matching Berkshire\u2019s payments no other businesses nor any of the country\u2019s 131 million households would have needed to pay any taxes to the federal government Not a dime  Millions billions trillions\u2013 we all know the words but the sums involved are almost impossible to comprehend Let\u2019s put physical dimensions to the numbers \u2022 If you convert 1 million into newlyprinted 100 bills you will have a stack that reaches your chest \u2022 Perform the same exercise with 1 billion\u2013 this is getting exciting\u2013 and the stack reaches about 3\u20444 of a mile into the sky \u2022 Finally imagine piling up 32 billion the total of Berkshire\u2019s 201221 federal income tax payments Now the stack grows to more than 21 miles in height about three times the level at which commercial airplanes usually cruise When it comes to federal taxes individuals who own Berkshire can unequivocally state \u201cI gave at the office\u201d  At Berkshire we hope and expect to pay much more in taxes during the next decade We owe the country no less America\u2019s dynamism has made a huge contribution to whatever success Berkshire has achieved\u2013 a contribution Berkshire will always need We count on the American Tailwind and though it has been becalmed from time to time its propelling force has always returned I have been investing for 80 years\u2013 more than onethird of our country\u2019s lifetime Despite our citizens\u2019 penchant\u2013 almost enthusiasm\u2013 for selfcriticism and selfdoubt I have yet to see a time when it made sense to make a longterm bet against America And I doubt very much that any reader of this letter will have a different experience in the future Nothing Beats Having a Great Partner Charlie and I think pretty much alike But what it takes me a page to explain he sums up in a sentence His version moreover is always more clearly reasoned and also more artfully\u2013 some might add bluntly\u2013 stated Here are a few of his thoughts many lifted from a very recent podcast \u2022 Theworld is full of foolish gamblers and they will not do as well as the patient investor \u2022 If you don\u2019t see the world the way it is it\u2019s like judging something through a distorted lens \u2022 All I want to know is where I\u2019m going to die so I\u2019ll never go there And a related thought Early on write your desired obituary\u2013 and then behave accordingly \u2022 If you don\u2019t care whether you are rational or not you won\u2019t work on it Then you will stay irrational and get lousy results 9 \u2022 Patience can be learned Having a long attention span and the ability to concentrate on one thing for a long time is a huge advantage \u2022 Youcan learn a lot from dead people Read of the deceased you admire and detest \u2022 Don\u2019t bail away in a sinking boat if you can swim to one that is seaworthy \u2022 Agreat company keeps working after you are not a mediocre company won\u2019t do that \u2022 Warren and I don\u2019t focus on the froth of the market We seek out good longterm investments and stubbornly hold them for a long time \u2022 Ben Graham said \u201cDay to day the stock market is a voting machine in the long term it\u2019s a weighing machine\u201d If you keep making something more valuable then some wise person is going to notice it and start buying \u2022 There is no such thing as a 100 sure thing when investing Thus the use of leverage is dangerous A string of wonderful numbers times zero will always equal zero Don\u2019t count on getting rich twice \u2022 Youdon\u2019t however need to own a lot of things in order to get rich \u2022 You have to keep learning if you want to become a great investor When the world changes you must change \u2022 Warren and I hated railroad stocks for decades but the world changed and finally the country had four huge railroads of vital importance to the American economy We were slow to recognize the change but better late than never \u2022 Finally I will add two short sentences by Charlie that have been his decisionclinchers for decades \u201cWarren think more about it You\u2019re smart and I\u2019m right\u201d And so it goes I never have a phone call with Charlie without learning something And while he makes me think he also makes me laugh  I will add to Charlie\u2019s list a rule of my own Find a very smart highgrade partner\u2013 preferably slightly older than you\u2013 and then listen very carefully to what he says AFamily Gathering in Omaha Charlie and I are shameless Last year at our first shareholder gettogether in three years we greeted you with our usual commercial hustle From the opening bell we went straight for your wallet In short order our See\u2019s kiosk sold you eleven tons of nourishing peanut brittle and chocolates In our PT Barnum pitch we promised you longevity After all what else but candy from See\u2019s could account for Charlie and me making it to 99 and 92 I know you can\u2019t wait to hear the specifics of last year\u2019s hustle On Friday the doors were open from noon until 5 pm and our candy counters rang up 2690 individual sales On Saturday See\u2019s registered an additional 3931 transactions between 7 am and 430 pm despite the fact that 61\u20442 of the 91\u20442 operating hours occurred while our movie and the questionandanswer session were limiting commercial traffic 10 Do the math See\u2019s rang up about 10 sales per minute during its prime operating time racking up 400309 of volume during the two days with all the goods purchased at a single location selling products that haven\u2019t been materially altered in 101 years What worked for See\u2019s in the days of Henry Ford\u2019s model T works now  Charlie I and the entire Berkshire bunch look forward to seeing you in Omaha on May 56 We will have a good time and so will

aroundtheclock to make sure our products were helpful to people who needed them from providing trustworthy information on Search to disrupting cyberattacks to partnering with the government to deploy air raid alerts In March I traveled to Warsaw Poland where I met Googlers hosting families who sought refuge talked with entrepreneurs using our office spaces and saw how our products like Google Translate were helping Ukrainians find a bit of hope and connection By late spring the tech industry was adjusting to a more challenging macroeconomic environment and as a company we embarked on efforts to sharpen our focus and make sure our efforts are aligned with our highest priorities Near the end of the year AI reached an inflection point made possible by our foundational breakthroughs like Transformer and advances in diffusion models It was an exciting moment for us after having worked to develop the technology responsibly for so many years And on December 18 during the World Cup final Google Search saw its highest querypersecond volume of all time a strong signal of our momentum Through it all we launched new products that helped us advance our mission to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful Over the past few years AI has emerged as the most important way we can advance our mission and in 2022 we made some of our biggest technological advancements yet  In the area of natural language understanding our latest model PaLM demonstrates breakthrough capabilities in language reasoning and code tasks Breakthroughs in \u201cchain of thought\u201d prompting are helping to build systems that can perform multistep reasoning and break down complex problems into smaller tasks We also shared new generative models including Imagen our texttoimage model and Phenaki which can generate long coherent videos from text prompts It\u2019s been especially exciting to see how AI advancements are making our products more helpful Last year we launched multisearch a new way to search using both text and images and it\u2019s now available in more than  70 languages People use Lens more than 10 billion  times per month to search with their camera or images  and its new AIpowered translation feature blends translated text seamlessly into the background of images And thanks to a new machine learning technique we added 24 new languages to Google Translate including its first indigenous languages of the Americas The breakthroughs we\u2019re seeing are poised to transform every industry and we\u2019re helping businesses tap into the new opportunities AI creates Last year we announced new products to help businesses solve problems using AI including Translation Hub which can be used to translate documents into 135 languages at a previously unimaginable scale and speed We brought more AIpowered features to Google Workspace including automatic summarization for Google Docs and Chat to help people get work done faster To help advertisers create meaningful performance last year we started incorporating large language models into broad match  a tool that makes it easier to match advertiser offers  to search queries In the first few months of 2023 we\u2019ve continued to roll out new products and features that help unlock incredible opportunities for consumers partners and businesses including ours Among them we introduced PaLM API  an easy and safe way for developers to build on top of our language models and generative AI capabilities in Google Contents Cloud and Workspace We also launched Bard an early experiment for people to collaborate with generative AI It\u2019s one way we are giving users direct access to large language models and part of a natural journey where we\u2019ll continue to iterate and make progress  Delivering products built to help 12  Building trust  by building a safer digital world 16  Helping our  customers and partners evolve and grow 19  Our commitments 20  Supporting economic resilience for  people communities  and businesses 24  Advancing equity  and inclusion 28  Taking on the  climate crisis 31  Other Bets Inside back cover  Directors and executive officers AI is also helping us to find solutions to some of the world\u2019s biggest problems We partnered with iCad to license our mammography technology for breast cancer screenings which is being used in clinics for the first time DeepMind\u2019s AlphaFold database grew by orders  of magnitude expanding from about one million to  200 million structures One million researchers have used it around the world to help solve problems in sustainability drug discovery human biology and more Beyond AI we\u2019re excited about the continued momentum across our businesses Just a few examples YouTube Premium is now up to 80 million paying subscribers and trialers an increase of 30 million from the year before And YouTube Shorts is now averaging more than 50 billion daily views We introduced our newest lineup of Pixel devices and our Pixel 6a Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro are the bestselling generation of phones we\u2019ve ever launched And we continue to open cloud regions and

through the cycle Chevron Corporation 2022 Annual Report IV the energy landscape Postpandemic demand recovery coupled with supply uncertainty created energy market volatility during the past year Geopolitical events threatened to disrupt energy supply OPEC spare capacity declined and inventories were at low levels relative to demand At the same time in much of the world strong consumer spending and increased travel drove an oil demand increase estimated at 23 million barrels per day In 2023 demand is projected to grow to greater than 101 million barrels per day an alltime high Natural gas demand declined slightly last year as higher prices related to supply disruptions resulting from the RussiaUkraine conflict prompted fuel substitution and demand destruction especially in Europe Global trade flows of liquefied natural gas LNG pivoted to Europe keeping LNG capacity tight Global natural gas demand is projected to grow in 2023 As growth in the global economy drives greater overall energy demand investment in lower carbon energy technologies will also continue to grow \u201cwe aim to lead in lower carbon intensity oil products and natural gas\u201d advancing energy progress Our capabilities assets and customer relationships are distinct advantages We\u2019re building on these strengths as we aim to lead in lower carbon intensity oil products and natural

ongoing economic social and geopolitical volatility At the same time we have entered a new age of AI that will fundamentally transform productivity for every individual organization and industry on earth and help us address some of our most pressing challengesThis next generation of AI will reshape every software category and every business including our own Fortyeight years after its founding Microsoft remains a consequential company because time and time again\u2014from PCServer to WebInternet to CloudMobile\u2014we have adapted to technological paradigm shifts Today we are doing so once again as we lead this new eraAmid this transformation our mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more remains constant As a company we believe we can be the democratizing force for this new generation of technology and the opportunity it will help unlock for every country community and individual while mitigating its risksHere are just a few examples of how we are already doing this\u2022\tLeading electronic health records vendor Epic is addressing some of the biggest challenges facing the healthcare industry today\u2014including physician burnout\u2014by deploying a wide range of copilot solutions built on Azure OpenAI Service and Dragon Ambient eXperience Copilot\u2022\tMercado Libre is reducing the time its developers spend writing code by more than 50 percent with GitHub Copilot as the company works to democratize ecommerce across Latin America\u2022\tMercedesBenz is making its incar voice assistant more intuitive for hundreds of thousands of drivers using ChatGPT via the Azure OpenAI Service \u2022\tLumen Technologies is helping its employees be more productive enabling them to focus on higher valueadded activities by deploying Microsoft 365 Copilot\u2022\tNonprofit The Contingent is matching foster families with children in need using Dynamics 365 Power BI and Azure with an eye on using AI to amplify its work across the US\u2022\tAnd Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of Education has built an online platform to help elementary and high school students learn English using Azure AITo build on this progress we remain convicted on three things First we will maintain our lead as the top commercial cloud while innovating in consumer categories from gaming to professional social networks Second because we know that maximum enterprise value gets created during platform shifts like this one we will invest to accelerate our lead in AI by infusing this technology across every layer of the tech stack And finally we will continue to drive operating leverage aligning our cost structure with our revenue growthAs we make progress on these priorities we delivered strong results in fiscal year 2023 including a record 211 billion in revenue and over 88 billion in operating income A NEW ERA OF AIThere are two breakthroughs coming together to define this new era of AI The first is the most universal interface natural language The long arc of computing has in many ways been shaped by the pursuit of increasingly intuitive humancomputer interfaces\u2014keyboards mice touch screens We believe we have now arrived at the next big step forward\u2014natural language\u2014and will quickly go beyond to see hear interpret and make sense of our intent and the world around usThe second is the emergence of a powerful new reasoning engine For years we\u2019ve digitized daily life places and things and organized them into databases But in a world rich with data what has been most scarce is our ability to reason over it This generation of AI helps us interact with data in powerful new ways\u2014from completing or summarizing text to detecting anomalies and recognizing images\u2014to help us identify patterns and surface insights faster than everTogether these two breakthroughs will unlock massive new opportunity And in fact just last month we announced our vision for Copilot an everyday AI companion We are building Copilot into all our most used products and experiences and allowing people to summon its power as a standalone app as well Just like you boot up an OS to access applications or use a browser to visit websites today our belief is that you will invoke a Copilot to do all those activities and more to shop to code to analyze to learn to createAs a company any time we approach a transition like this we do so responsibly We believe AI should be as empowering across communities as it is powerful and we\u2019re committed to ensuring it is responsibly built and designed with safety in mind from the outset OUR OPPORTUNITYEvery customer solution area and every layer of our tech stack will be reimagined for the AI era And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve already begun to doInfrastructureFour years ago we first invested in our AI supercomputer with a goal of building the best cloud for training and inference Today it\u2019s being used by our partner OpenAI to power its bestinclass foundation models and services including one of the fastestgrowing consumer apps ever\u2014ChatGPT NVIDIA as well as leading AI startups like Adept and Inflection is also using our infrastructure to build its own breakthrough models More broadly organizations continue to choose our ubiquitous computing fabric\u2014from cloud to edge\u2014to run their missioncritical applications We continued to see more cloud migrations to Azure this past fiscal year as it remains early when it comes to the longterm cloud opportunity And we also continue to lead in hybrid computing with Azure Arc which now has 18000 customers Data and AIEvery AI app starts with data and having a comprehensive data and analytics platform is more important than ever Our Intelligent Data Platform brings together operational databases analytics and governance so organizations can spend more time creating value and less time integrating their data estate We also introduced Microsoft Fabric this year which unifies compute storage and governance with a disruptive business modelWith Azure AI we are making foundation models available as platforms to our customers We offer the best selection of industryleading frontier and open models In January we made the Azure OpenAI Service broadly available bringing together advanced models including ChatGPT and GPT4 with the enterprise capabilities of Azure More than 11000 organizations across industries are already using it for advanced scenarios like content and code generation Meta chose us this summer as its preferred cloud to commercialize its Llama family of models And with Azure AI Studio we provide a full lifecycle toolchain customers can use to ground these models on their own data create prompt workflows and help ensure they are deployed and used safely Digital and app innovationGitHub Copilot is fundamentally transforming developer productivity helping developers complete coding tasks 55 percent faster More than 27000 organizations have chosen GitHub Copilot for Business and to date more than 1 million people have used GitHub Copilot to code faster We also announced our vision for the future of software development with GitHub Copilot X which will bring the power of AI throughout the entire software development lifecycle All up GitHub surpassed 1 billion in annual recurring revenue for the first time this fiscal year We\u2019re also applying AI across our lowcodenocode toolchain to help domain experts across an organization automate workflows create apps and webpages build virtual agents or analyze data using just natural language with copilots in Power Platform More than 63000 organizations have used AIpowered capabilities in Power Platform to dateBusiness applications We are bringing the next generation of AI to employees across every job function and every line of business with Dynamics 365 Copilot which works across CRM and ERP systems to reduce burdensome tasks like manual data entry content generation and notetaking In fact our own support agents are using Copilot in Dynamics 365 Customer Service to resolve more cases faster and without having to call on peers to help With our Supply Chain Platform we\u2019re helping customers apply AI to predict and mitigate disruptions And with our new Microsoft Sales Copilot sellers can infuse their customer interactions with data from CRM systems\u2014including both Salesforce and Dynamics\u2014to close more deals All up Dynamics surpassed 5 billion in revenue over the past fiscal year with our customer experience service and finance and supply chain businesses each surpassing 1 billion in annual salesIndustry Across industries we are rapidly becoming the partner of choice for any organization looking to generate real value from AI In healthcare for example we introduced the world\u2019s first fully automated clinical documentation application DAX Copilot The application helps physicians reduce documentation time by half freeing them to spend more time face to face with patients And Epic will integrate it directly into its electronic health records system And in retail we introduced new tools to help companies manage their daytoday operations and digitize their physical storesModern workWe are rapidly evolving Microsoft 365 into an AIfirst platform that enables every individual to amplify their creativity and productivity with both our established applications like Office and Teams as well as new apps like Designer Stream and Loop Microsoft 365 is designed for today\u2019s digitally connected distributed workforceThis year we also introduced a new pillar of customer value with Microsoft 365 Copilot which combines nextgeneration AI with business data in the Microsoft Graph and Microsoft 365 applications to help people be more productive and unleash their creativity at work Just last month I was excited to announce that we will make Microsoft 365 Copilot generally available to our commercial customers later this yearWe continue to build momentum in Microsoft Teams across collaboration chat meetings and calls We introduced a new version of Teams that delivers up to two times faster performance while using 50 percent less memory We also introduced Teams Premium to meet enterprise demand for AIpowered features like intelligent meeting recaps All up Teams usage surpassed 300 million monthly active users this yearWith Microsoft Viva we have created a new category for employee experience Copilot in Viva offers leaders a new way to build highperformance teams by prioritizing both productivity and employee engagement This year Viva surpassed 35 million monthly active usersSecurityAs the rate and pace of cyberthreats continue to accelerate security is a top priority for

advertising and newsWe are reshaping daily search and web habits with our new Bing and Microsoft Edge browser which brings together search browsing chat and AI into one unified experience to deliver better search more complete answers a new chat experience and the ability to generate content We think of these tools as an AI copilot for the web We are also bringing these breakthrough capabilities to businesses with Bing Chat Enterprise which offers commercial data protection providing an easy onramp for any organization looking to get the benefit of nextgeneration AI today Although it\u2019s early in our journey Bing users engaged in more than 1 billion chats and created more than 750 million images over the past year as they apply these new tools to get things done And Edge has taken share for nine consecutive quartersMore broadly we continue to expand our opportunity in advertising This year Netflix chose us as its exclusive technology and sales partner for its first adsupported subscription offering a validation of the differentiated value we provide to any publisher looking for a flexible partner to build and innovate with themLinkedInThe excitement around AI is creating new opportunities across every function\u2014from marketing sales service and finance to software development and security And LinkedIn is increasingly where people are going to learn discuss and uplevel their skills We are using AI to help our members and customers connect to opportunities and tap into the experiences of experts on the platform In fact our AIpowered articles are already the fastestgrowing traffic driver to the networkAll up LinkedIn\u2019s revenue surpassed 15 billion for the first time this fiscal year a testament to how mission critical the platform has become to help more than 950 million members connect learn sell and get hiredGamingIn gaming we are rapidly executing on our ambition to be the first choice for people to play great games whenever wherever and however they want With Xbox Game Pass we are redefining how games are distributed played and viewed Content is the flywheel behind the service\u2019s growth and our pipeline has never been stronger It was especially energizing to release Starfield this fall to broad acclaim with more than 10 million players in the first month postlaunch aloneEarlier this month we were thrilled to close our acquisition of Activision Blizzard and we look forward to sharing more in the coming months about how together we will bring the joy of gaming to more people around the worldDevices and creativityFinally we\u2019re turning Windows into a powerful new AI canvas with Copilot which rolled out as part of a Windows 11 update last month It uniquely incorporates the context and intelligence of the web your work data and what you are doing in the moment on your PC to provide better assistance while keeping your privacy and security at the forefront Overall the number of devices running Windows 11 more than doubled in the past year And we are also transforming how Windows is experienced and managed with Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365 which together surpassed 1 billion in annual revenue for the first timeOUR RESPONSIBILITYAs we pursue our opportunity we are also working to ensure technology helps us solve problems\u2014not create new ones To do this we focus on four enduring commitments that are central to our mission and that take on even greater importance in this new era For us these commitments are more than just words They\u2019re a guide to help us make decisions across everything we do\u2014as we design and develop products shape business processes and policies help our customers thrive build partnerships and more \u2014always asking ourselves critical questions to ensure our actions are aligned with themHow can we expand opportunityFirst we believe access to economic growth and opportunity should reach every person organization community and country And although AI can serve as a catalyst for opportunity and growth we must first ensure everyone has access to the technologies data and skills they need to benefitTo achieve this we are focused on getting technology into the hands of nonprofits social entrepreneurs and other civil society organizations to help them digitally transform so they can help address some of society\u2019s biggest challenges This year we provided nonprofits with over 38 billion in discounted and donated technology Nearly 325000 nonprofits used our cloud And to help them tap the potential of AI we\u2019re building new AI capabilities for fundraising marketing and program deliveryAI will displace some jobs but it will also create new ones That\u2019s why we aim to train and certify 10 million people by 2025 with the skills for jobs and livelihoods in an increasingly digital economy Since July 2020 we\u2019ve helped 85 million people including 27 million this year We\u2019ve also focused on skilling women and underrepresented communities in cybersecurity working across 28 countries and with nearly 400 US community colleges to scale our effortsFinally to help people learn more about AI we launched the first online Professional Certificate on Generative AI in partnership with LinkedIn Learning created AI tools for educators and held our first AI Community Learning event in the US These events will be replicated around the world and localized in 10 languages over the next year We also partnered to launch a Generative AI Skills Grant Challenge to explore how nonprofit social enterprise and research or academic institutions can empower the workforce to use this new generation of AIHow can we earn trust To create positive impact with technology people need to be able to trust the technologies they use and the companies behind them For us earning trust spans the responsible use of AI protecting privacy and advancing digital safety and cybersecurity  Our commitment to responsible AI is not new Since 2017 we\u2019ve worked to develop our responsible AI practice recognizing that trust is never given but earned through action We have translated our AI principles into a core set of implementation processes as well as tools training and practices to support compliance But internal programs aren\u2019t enough We also enable our customers and partners to develop and deploy AI safely including through our AI customer commitments and services like Azure AI Studio with its content safety tooling and access to our Responsible AI dashboard Building AI responsibly requires that we work with other industry leaders civil society and governments to advocate for AI regulations and governance globally This year we released our Governing AI Blueprint which outlines concrete legal and policy recommendations for AI guardrails We are signatories to the eight voluntary commitments developed with the US White House and proud of the six additional commitments we\u2019ve made to further strengthen and operationalize the principles of safety security and trust The era of AI heightens the importance of cybersecurity and we deepened our work across the private and public sectors to improve cyberresilience We\u2019ve continued to support Ukraine in defending critical infrastructure detecting and disrupting cyberattacks and cyberinfluence operations and providing intelligence related to these attacks Our Microsoft Threat Analysis Center team produced more than 500 intelligence reports to help keep customers and the public informed And we published our third annual Microsoft Digital Defense Report sharing our learnings and security recommendations We also remain committed to creating safe experiences online and protecting customers from illegal and harmful content and conduct while respecting human rights We supported the Christchurch Call Initiative on Algorithmic Outcomes to address terrorist and violent and extremist content online And through the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Coalition for Digital Safety we coled the development of new global principles for digital safety Protecting customers\u2019 privacy and giving them control of their data is more important than ever We\u2019ve begun our phased rollout of the EU Data Boundary supporting our commercial and public sector customers\u2019 need for data sovereignty And each month more than 3 million people exercise their data protection rights through our privacy dashboard making meaningful choices about how their data is used How can we protect fundamental rightsIn an increasingly digital world we have a responsibility to promote and protect people\u2019s fundamental rights and address the challenges technology creates For us this means upholding responsible business practices expanding connectivity and accessibility advancing fair and inclusive societies and empowering communities In 2023 we worked diligently to anticipate harmful uses of our technology and put guardrails on the use of technologies that are consequential to people\u2019s lives or legal status create risk of harm or threaten human rights We will continue to assess the impact of our technologies engage our stakeholders and model and adopt responsible practices and respect for human rights\u2014including across our global supply chainToday our lives are more connected than ever Access to education employment healthcare and other critical services is increasingly dependent on technology That\u2019s why we\u2019ve expanded our commitment to bring access to affordable highspeed internet to a quarter of a billion people around the world including 100 million people in Africa by the end of 2025 Since 2017 we\u2019ve helped bring internet access to 63 million people a key first step to ensuring communities will have access to AI and other digital technologies This year we also continued working toward our fiveyear commitment to bridge the disability divide with a focus on helping close the accessibility knowledge gap Seven hundred and fiftythousand learners enriched their understanding of disability and accessibility in partnership with LinkedIn Learning Teach Access and the Microsoft disability community In addition we\u2019re stepping up efforts to combat online disinformation through new media content provenance technologies\u2014enabling users to verify if an image or video was generated by AI We continued our efforts to promote racial equity across Microsoft our ecosystem and our communities including our work to advance justice reform through datadriven insights And we provided support in response to eight humanitarian disasters including committing 540 million of support to those who have been impacted by the War in Ukraine Finally recognizing AI\u2019s potential to advance human rights and humanitarian action we worked on several AI for Humanitarian Action projects Together with our partners we\u2019re building the capabilities to identify atrisk communities estimate seasonal hunger predict malnutrition and assist in disease identification How can we advance sustainabilityClimate change is the defining issue of our generation and addressing it requires swift collective action and technological innovation We are committed to meeting our own goals while enabling others to do the same That means taking responsibility for our operational footprint and accelerating progress through technology We continue to see extreme weather impacting communities globally To meet the urgent need this must be a decade of innovation and decisive action\u2014for Microsoft our customers and the world In our latest Environmental Sustainability Report we shared our progress toward our 2030 sustainability targets across carbon water waste and ecosystems In 2022 our overall carbon emissions declined by 05 percent while our business grew Addressing scope 3 emissions which account for the vast majority of our emissions is arguably our ultimate challenge\u2014one we\u2019ll continue to tackle through our supply chain policy advances and industrywide knowledgesharingWe\u2019ve provided just under 1 million people with access to clean water and sanitation one of five pillars on our path to becoming water positive And in our pursuit to be zero waste we achieved a reuse and recycle rate of 82 percent for all our cloud hardware and diverted over 12000 metric tons of solid operational waste from landfills and incinerators We also continue to take responsibility for the impacts of our direct operations on Earth\u2019s ecosystems We\u2019ve contracted to protect 17268 acres of land over 50 percent more than the land we use to operate Of that 12270 acres\u2014the equivalent of approximately 7000 soccer fields\u2014were designated as permanently protected Technology is a powerful lever to help us avoid the most severe impacts of climate change That\u2019s why we\u2019re accelerating our investment in more efficient datacenters clean energy enhancements to the Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability and Planetary Computer and green software practices To date through our Climate Innovation Fund we\u2019ve allocated more than 700 million to a global portfolio of 50 investments spanning sustainable solutions in energy industrial and natural systems Finally we believe AI can be a powerful accelerant in addressing the climate crisis We expanded our AI for Good Lab in Egypt and Kenya to improve climate resilience for the continent And together with our partners we launched Global Renewables Watch a firstofitskind living atlas that aims to map and measure utilityscale solar and wind installations allowing users to evaluate progress toward a clean energy transition Although this new era promises great opportunity it demands even greater responsibility from companies like ours As we pursue our four commitments we focus on transparency\u2014providing clear reporting on how we run our business and how we work with customers and partners Our annual Impact Summary shares more about our progress and learnings this year and our Reports Hub provides detailed reports on our environmental data political activities workforce demographics human rights work and more OUR CULTUREThere\u2019s never been a more important time to live our culture The way we work and the speed at which we work are changing In an economy where yesterday\u2019s exceptional is today\u2019s expected all of us at Microsoft will need to embrace a growth mindset and more importantly confront our fixed mindsets as our culture evolves It will take everyday courage to reformulate what innovation business models and sales motions look like in this new era As a highperformance organization we aspire to help our employees maximize their economic opportunity while simultaneously helping them learn and grow professionally and connect their own passion and purpose with their everyday work and the company\u2019s missionTo be successful we need to be grounded in what our customers and the world need We need to innovate and collaborate as One Microsoft And we need to actively seek diversity and embrace inclusion to best serve our customers and create a culture where everyone can do their best work To empower the world we need to represent the world To that end we remain focused on increasing representation and strengthening our culture of inclusion Even as we navigated challenges this year our company continued to be the most globally diverse it\u2019s ever been Giving also remains core to our culture This year more than 105000 employees gave 242 million including company match to over 35000 nonprofits in 116 countries And our employees volunteered over 930000 hours to causes they care aboutI am deeply grateful to our employees for their commitment to the company and their communities and how they are living our mission and culture every day in a changing company and worldIn closing this is Microsoft\u2019s moment We have an incredible opportunity to use this new era of AI to deliver meaningful benefits for every person and every organization on the planet On New Year\u2019s Day I saw a tweet from Andrej Karpathy Tesla\u2019s former director of AI who now works at OpenAI about how GitHub Copilot was writing about 80 percent of his code with 80 percent accuracy Two days later I saw a stunning example of work we\u2019ve done with the government of India\u2019s Ministry of Electronics and IT which is applying an AI model so farmers in rural areas can interact with government resources in their native languages Think about that A foundation model that was developed on the West Coast of the United States is already transforming the lives of both elite developers and rural farmers on the other side of the globe We\u2019ve not seen this speed of diffusion and breadth of impact in the tech industry beforeAs a company this is our moment to show up and

ongoing economic social and geopolitical volatility At the same time we have entered a new age of AI that will fundamentally transform productivity for every individual organization and industry on earth and help us address some of our most pressing challengesThis next generation of AI will reshape every software category and every business including our own Fortyeight years after its founding Microsoft remains a consequential company because time and time again\u2014from PCServer to WebInternet to CloudMobile\u2014we have adapted to technological paradigm shifts Today we are doing so once again as we lead this new eraAmid this transformation our mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more remains constant As a company we believe we can be the democratizing force for this new generation of technology and the opportunity it will help unlock for every country community and individual while mitigating its risksHere are just a few examples of how we are already doing this\u2022\tLeading electronic health records vendor Epic is addressing some of the biggest challenges facing the healthcare industry today\u2014including physician burnout\u2014by deploying a wide range of copilot solutions built on Azure OpenAI Service and Dragon Ambient eXperience Copilot\u2022\tMercado Libre is reducing the time its developers spend writing code by more than 50 percent with GitHub Copilot as the company works to democratize ecommerce across Latin America\u2022\tMercedesBenz is making its incar voice assistant more intuitive for hundreds of thousands of drivers using ChatGPT via the Azure OpenAI Service \u2022\tLumen Technologies is helping its employees be more productive enabling them to focus on higher valueadded activities by deploying Microsoft 365 Copilot\u2022\tNonprofit The Contingent is matching foster families with children in need using Dynamics 365 Power BI and Azure with an eye on using AI to amplify its work across the US\u2022\tAnd Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of Education has built an online platform to help elementary and high school students learn English using Azure AITo build on this progress we remain convicted on three things First we will maintain our lead as the top commercial cloud while innovating in consumer categories from gaming to professional social networks Second because we know that maximum enterprise value gets created during platform shifts like this one we will invest to accelerate our lead in AI by infusing this technology across every layer of the tech stack And finally we will continue to drive operating leverage aligning our cost structure with our revenue growthAs we make progress on these priorities we delivered strong results in fiscal year 2023 including a record 211 billion in revenue and over 88 billion in operating income A NEW ERA OF AIThere are two breakthroughs coming together to define this new era of AI The first is the most universal interface natural language The long arc of computing has in many ways been shaped by the pursuit of increasingly intuitive humancomputer interfaces\u2014keyboards mice touch screens We believe we have now arrived at the next big step forward\u2014natural language\u2014and will quickly go beyond to see hear interpret and make sense of our intent and the world around usThe second is the emergence of a powerful new reasoning engine For years we\u2019ve digitized daily life places and things and organized them into databases But in a world rich with data what has been most scarce is our ability to reason over it This generation of AI helps us interact with data in powerful new ways\u2014from completing or summarizing text to detecting anomalies and recognizing images\u2014to help us identify patterns and surface insights faster than everTogether these two breakthroughs will unlock massive new opportunity And in fact just last month we announced our vision for Copilot an everyday AI companion We are building Copilot into all our most used products and experiences and allowing people to summon its power as a standalone app as well Just like you boot up an OS to access applications or use a browser to visit websites today our belief is that you will invoke a Copilot to do all those activities and more to shop to code to analyze to learn to createAs a company any time we approach a transition like this we do so responsibly We believe AI should be as empowering across communities as it is powerful and we\u2019re committed to ensuring it is responsibly built and designed with safety in mind from the outset OUR OPPORTUNITYEvery customer solution area and every layer of our tech stack will be reimagined for the AI era And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve already begun to doInfrastructureFour years ago we first invested in our AI supercomputer with a goal of building the best cloud for training and inference Today it\u2019s being used by our partner OpenAI to power its bestinclass foundation models and services including one of the fastestgrowing consumer apps ever\u2014ChatGPT NVIDIA as well as leading AI startups like Adept and Inflection is also using our infrastructure to build its own breakthrough models More broadly organizations continue to choose our ubiquitous computing fabric\u2014from cloud to edge\u2014to run their missioncritical applications We continued to see more cloud migrations to Azure this past fiscal year as it remains early when it comes to the longterm cloud opportunity And we also continue to lead in hybrid computing with Azure Arc which now has 18000 customers Data and AIEvery AI app starts with data and having a comprehensive data and analytics platform is more important than ever Our Intelligent Data Platform brings together operational databases analytics and governance so organizations can spend more time creating value and less time integrating their data estate We also introduced Microsoft Fabric this year which unifies compute storage and governance with a disruptive business modelWith Azure AI we are making foundation models available as platforms to our customers We offer the best selection of industryleading frontier and open models In January we made the Azure OpenAI Service broadly available bringing together advanced models including ChatGPT and GPT4 with the enterprise capabilities of Azure More than 11000 organizations across industries are already using it for advanced scenarios like content and code generation Meta chose us this summer as its preferred cloud to commercialize its Llama family of models And with Azure AI Studio we provide a full lifecycle toolchain customers can use to ground these models on their own data create prompt workflows and help ensure they are deployed and used safely Digital and app innovationGitHub Copilot is fundamentally transforming developer productivity helping developers complete coding tasks 55 percent faster More than 27000 organizations have chosen GitHub Copilot for Business and to date more than 1 million people have used GitHub Copilot to code faster We also announced our vision for the future of software development with GitHub Copilot X which will bring the power of AI throughout the entire software development lifecycle All up GitHub surpassed 1 billion in annual recurring revenue for the first time this fiscal year We\u2019re also applying AI across our lowcodenocode toolchain to help domain experts across an organization automate workflows create apps and webpages build virtual agents or analyze data using just natural language with copilots in Power Platform More than 63000 organizations have used AIpowered capabilities in Power Platform to dateBusiness applications We are bringing the next generation of AI to employees across every job function and every line of business with Dynamics 365 Copilot which works across CRM and ERP systems to reduce burdensome tasks like manual data entry content generation and notetaking In fact our own support agents are using Copilot in Dynamics 365 Customer Service to resolve more cases faster and without having to call on peers to help With our Supply Chain Platform we\u2019re helping customers apply AI to predict and mitigate disruptions And with our new Microsoft Sales Copilot sellers can infuse their customer interactions with data from CRM systems\u2014including both Salesforce and Dynamics\u2014to close more deals All up Dynamics surpassed 5 billion in revenue over the past fiscal year with our customer experience service and finance and supply chain businesses each surpassing 1 billion in annual salesIndustry Across industries we are rapidly becoming the partner of choice for any organization looking to generate real value from AI In healthcare for example we introduced the world\u2019s first fully automated clinical documentation application DAX Copilot The application helps physicians reduce documentation time by half freeing them to spend more time face to face with patients And Epic will integrate it directly into its electronic health records system And in retail we introduced new tools to help companies manage their daytoday operations and digitize their physical storesModern workWe are rapidly evolving Microsoft 365 into an AIfirst platform that enables every individual to amplify their creativity and productivity with both our established applications like Office and Teams as well as new apps like Designer Stream and Loop Microsoft 365 is designed for today\u2019s digitally connected distributed workforceThis year we also introduced a new pillar of customer value with Microsoft 365 Copilot which combines nextgeneration AI with business data in the Microsoft Graph and Microsoft 365 applications to help people be more productive and unleash their creativity at work Just last month I was excited to announce that we will make Microsoft 365 Copilot generally available to our commercial customers later this yearWe continue to build momentum in Microsoft Teams across collaboration chat meetings and calls We introduced a new version of Teams that delivers up to two times faster performance while using 50 percent less memory We also introduced Teams Premium to meet enterprise demand for AIpowered features like intelligent meeting recaps All up Teams usage surpassed 300 million monthly active users this yearWith Microsoft Viva we have created a new category for employee experience Copilot in Viva offers leaders a new way to build highperformance teams by prioritizing both productivity and employee engagement This year Viva surpassed 35 million monthly active usersSecurityAs the rate and pace of cyberthreats continue to accelerate security is a top priority for

advertising and newsWe are reshaping daily search and web habits with our new Bing and Microsoft Edge browser which brings together search browsing chat and AI into one unified experience to deliver better search more complete answers a new chat experience and the ability to generate content We think of these tools as an AI copilot for the web We are also bringing these breakthrough capabilities to businesses with Bing Chat Enterprise which offers commercial data protection providing an easy onramp for any organization looking to get the benefit of nextgeneration AI today Although it\u2019s early in our journey Bing users engaged in more than 1 billion chats and created more than 750 million images over the past year as they apply these new tools to get things done And Edge has taken share for nine consecutive quartersMore broadly we continue to expand our opportunity in advertising This year Netflix chose us as its exclusive technology and sales partner for its first adsupported subscription offering a validation of the differentiated value we provide to any publisher looking for a flexible partner to build and innovate with themLinkedInThe excitement around AI is creating new opportunities across every function\u2014from marketing sales service and finance to software development and security And LinkedIn is increasingly where people are going to learn discuss and uplevel their skills We are using AI to help our members and customers connect to opportunities and tap into the experiences of experts on the platform In fact our AIpowered articles are already the fastestgrowing traffic driver to the networkAll up LinkedIn\u2019s revenue surpassed 15 billion for the first time this fiscal year a testament to how mission critical the platform has become to help more than 950 million members connect learn sell and get hiredGamingIn gaming we are rapidly executing on our ambition to be the first choice for people to play great games whenever wherever and however they want With Xbox Game Pass we are redefining how games are distributed played and viewed Content is the flywheel behind the service\u2019s growth and our pipeline has never been stronger It was especially energizing to release Starfield this fall to broad acclaim with more than 10 million players in the first month postlaunch aloneEarlier this month we were thrilled to close our acquisition of Activision Blizzard and we look forward to sharing more in the coming months about how together we will bring the joy of gaming to more people around the worldDevices and creativityFinally we\u2019re turning Windows into a powerful new AI canvas with Copilot which rolled out as part of a Windows 11 update last month It uniquely incorporates the context and intelligence of the web your work data and what you are doing in the moment on your PC to provide better assistance while keeping your privacy and security at the forefront Overall the number of devices running Windows 11 more than doubled in the past year And we are also transforming how Windows is experienced and managed with Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365 which together surpassed 1 billion in annual revenue for the first timeOUR RESPONSIBILITYAs we pursue our opportunity we are also working to ensure technology helps us solve problems\u2014not create new ones To do this we focus on four enduring commitments that are central to our mission and that take on even greater importance in this new era For us these commitments are more than just words They\u2019re a guide to help us make decisions across everything we do\u2014as we design and develop products shape business processes and policies help our customers thrive build partnerships and more \u2014always asking ourselves critical questions to ensure our actions are aligned with themHow can we expand opportunityFirst we believe access to economic growth and opportunity should reach every person organization community and country And although AI can serve as a catalyst for opportunity and growth we must first ensure everyone has access to the technologies data and skills they need to benefitTo achieve this we are focused on getting technology into the hands of nonprofits social entrepreneurs and other civil society organizations to help them digitally transform so they can help address some of society\u2019s biggest challenges This year we provided nonprofits with over 38 billion in discounted and donated technology Nearly 325000 nonprofits used our cloud And to help them tap the potential of AI we\u2019re building new AI capabilities for fundraising marketing and program deliveryAI will displace some jobs but it will also create new ones That\u2019s why we aim to train and certify 10 million people by 2025 with the skills for jobs and livelihoods in an increasingly digital economy Since July 2020 we\u2019ve helped 85 million people including 27 million this year We\u2019ve also focused on skilling women and underrepresented communities in cybersecurity working across 28 countries and with nearly 400 US community colleges to scale our effortsFinally to help people learn more about AI we launched the first online Professional Certificate on Generative AI in partnership with LinkedIn Learning created AI tools for educators and held our first AI Community Learning event in the US These events will be replicated around the world and localized in 10 languages over the next year We also partnered to launch a Generative AI Skills Grant Challenge to explore how nonprofit social enterprise and research or academic institutions can empower the workforce to use this new generation of AIHow can we earn trust To create positive impact with technology people need to be able to trust the technologies they use and the companies behind them For us earning trust spans the responsible use of AI protecting privacy and advancing digital safety and cybersecurity  Our commitment to responsible AI is not new Since 2017 we\u2019ve worked to develop our responsible AI practice recognizing that trust is never given but earned through action We have translated our AI principles into a core set of implementation processes as well as tools training and practices to support compliance But internal programs aren\u2019t enough We also enable our customers and partners to develop and deploy AI safely including through our AI customer commitments and services like Azure AI Studio with its content safety tooling and access to our Responsible AI dashboard Building AI responsibly requires that we work with other industry leaders civil society and governments to advocate for AI regulations and governance globally This year we released our Governing AI Blueprint which outlines concrete legal and policy recommendations for AI guardrails We are signatories to the eight voluntary commitments developed with the US White House and proud of the six additional commitments we\u2019ve made to further strengthen and operationalize the principles of safety security and trust The era of AI heightens the importance of cybersecurity and we deepened our work across the private and public sectors to improve cyberresilience We\u2019ve continued to support Ukraine in defending critical infrastructure detecting and disrupting cyberattacks and cyberinfluence operations and providing intelligence related to these attacks Our Microsoft Threat Analysis Center team produced more than 500 intelligence reports to help keep customers and the public informed And we published our third annual Microsoft Digital Defense Report sharing our learnings and security recommendations We also remain committed to creating safe experiences online and protecting customers from illegal and harmful content and conduct while respecting human rights We supported the Christchurch Call Initiative on Algorithmic Outcomes to address terrorist and violent and extremist content online And through the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Coalition for Digital Safety we coled the development of new global principles for digital safety Protecting customers\u2019 privacy and giving them control of their data is more important than ever We\u2019ve begun our phased rollout of the EU Data Boundary supporting our commercial and public sector customers\u2019 need for data sovereignty And each month more than 3 million people exercise their data protection rights through our privacy dashboard making meaningful choices about how their data is used How can we protect fundamental rightsIn an increasingly digital world we have a responsibility to promote and protect people\u2019s fundamental rights and address the challenges technology creates For us this means upholding responsible business practices expanding connectivity and accessibility advancing fair and inclusive societies and empowering communities In 2023 we worked diligently to anticipate harmful uses of our technology and put guardrails on the use of technologies that are consequential to people\u2019s lives or legal status create risk of harm or threaten human rights We will continue to assess the impact of our technologies engage our stakeholders and model and adopt responsible practices and respect for human rights\u2014including across our global supply chainToday our lives are more connected than ever Access to education employment healthcare and other critical services is increasingly dependent on technology That\u2019s why we\u2019ve expanded our commitment to bring access to affordable highspeed internet to a quarter of a billion people around the world including 100 million people in Africa by the end of 2025 Since 2017 we\u2019ve helped bring internet access to 63 million people a key first step to ensuring communities will have access to AI and other digital technologies This year we also continued working toward our fiveyear commitment to bridge the disability divide with a focus on helping close the accessibility knowledge gap Seven hundred and fiftythousand learners enriched their understanding of disability and accessibility in partnership with LinkedIn Learning Teach Access and the Microsoft disability community In addition we\u2019re stepping up efforts to combat online disinformation through new media content provenance technologies\u2014enabling users to verify if an image or video was generated by AI We continued our efforts to promote racial equity across Microsoft our ecosystem and our communities including our work to advance justice reform through datadriven insights And we provided support in response to eight humanitarian disasters including committing 540 million of support to those who have been impacted by the War in Ukraine Finally recognizing AI\u2019s potential to advance human rights and humanitarian action we worked on several AI for Humanitarian Action projects Together with our partners we\u2019re building the capabilities to identify atrisk communities estimate seasonal hunger predict malnutrition and assist in disease identification How can we advance sustainabilityClimate change is the defining issue of our generation and addressing it requires swift collective action and technological innovation We are committed to meeting our own goals while enabling others to do the same That means taking responsibility for our operational footprint and accelerating progress through technology We continue to see extreme weather impacting communities globally To meet the urgent need this must be a decade of innovation and decisive action\u2014for Microsoft our customers and the world In our latest Environmental Sustainability Report we shared our progress toward our 2030 sustainability targets across carbon water waste and ecosystems In 2022 our overall carbon emissions declined by 05 percent while our business grew Addressing scope 3 emissions which account for the vast majority of our emissions is arguably our ultimate challenge\u2014one we\u2019ll continue to tackle through our supply chain policy advances and industrywide knowledgesharingWe\u2019ve provided just under 1 million people with access to clean water and sanitation one of five pillars on our path to becoming water positive And in our pursuit to be zero waste we achieved a reuse and recycle rate of 82 percent for all our cloud hardware and diverted over 12000 metric tons of solid operational waste from landfills and incinerators We also continue to take responsibility for the impacts of our direct operations on Earth\u2019s ecosystems We\u2019ve contracted to protect 17268 acres of land over 50 percent more than the land we use to operate Of that 12270 acres\u2014the equivalent of approximately 7000 soccer fields\u2014were designated as permanently protected Technology is a powerful lever to help us avoid the most severe impacts of climate change That\u2019s why we\u2019re accelerating our investment in more efficient datacenters clean energy enhancements to the Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability and Planetary Computer and green software practices To date through our Climate Innovation Fund we\u2019ve allocated more than 700 million to a global portfolio of 50 investments spanning sustainable solutions in energy industrial and natural systems Finally we believe AI can be a powerful accelerant in addressing the climate crisis We expanded our AI for Good Lab in Egypt and Kenya to improve climate resilience for the continent And together with our partners we launched Global Renewables Watch a

closing this is Microsoft\u2019s moment We have an incredible opportunity to use this new era of AI to deliver meaningful benefits for every person and every organization on the planet On New Year\u2019s Day I saw a tweet from Andrej Karpathy Tesla\u2019s former director of AI who now works at OpenAI about how GitHub Copilot was writing about 80 percent of his code with 80 percent accuracy Two days later I saw a stunning example of work we\u2019ve done with the government of India\u2019s Ministry of Electronics and IT which is applying an AI model so farmers in rural areas can interact with government resources in their native languages Think about that A foundation model that was developed on the West Coast of the United States is already transforming the lives of both elite developers and rural farmers on the other side of the globe We\u2019ve not seen this speed of diffusion and breadth of impact in the tech industry beforeAs a company this is our moment to show up and responsibly build solutions that drive economic growth and benefit every community country industry and person If we do it well the world will do well and Microsoft will do well too I\u2019ve never been more confident that we will deliver on this promise together in the days months and years to come

ongoing economic social and geopolitical volatility At the same time we have entered a new age of AI that will fundamentally transform productivity for every individual organization and industry on earth and help us address some of our most pressing challengesThis next generation of AI will reshape every software category and every business including our own Fortyeight years after its founding Microsoft remains a consequential company because time and time again\u2014from PCServer to WebInternet to CloudMobile\u2014we have adapted to technological paradigm shifts Today we are doing so once again as we lead this new eraAmid this transformation our mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more remains constant As a company we believe we can be the democratizing force for this new generation of technology and the opportunity it will help unlock for every country community and individual while mitigating its risksHere are just a few examples of how we are already doing this\u2022\tLeading electronic health records vendor Epic is addressing some of the biggest challenges facing the healthcare industry today\u2014including physician burnout\u2014by deploying a wide range of copilot solutions built on Azure OpenAI Service and Dragon Ambient eXperience Copilot\u2022\tMercado Libre is reducing the time its developers spend writing code by more than 50 percent with GitHub Copilot as the company works to democratize ecommerce across Latin America\u2022\tMercedesBenz is making its incar voice assistant more intuitive for hundreds

across the US\u2022\tAnd Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of Education has built an online platform to help elementary and high school students learn English using Azure AITo build on this progress we remain convicted on three things First we will maintain our lead as the top commercial cloud while innovating in consumer categories from gaming to professional social networks Second because we know that maximum enterprise value gets created during platform shifts like this one we will invest to accelerate our lead in AI by infusing this technology across every layer of the tech stack And finally we will continue to drive operating leverage aligning our cost structure with our revenue growthAs we make progress on these priorities we delivered strong results in fiscal year 2023 including a record 211 billion in revenue and over 88 billion in operating income A NEW ERA OF AIThere are two breakthroughs coming together to define this new era of AI The first is the most universal interface natural language The long arc of computing has in many ways been shaped by the pursuit of increasingly intuitive humancomputer interfaces\u2014keyboards mice touch screens We believe we have now arrived at the next big step forward\u2014natural language\u2014and will quickly go beyond to see hear interpret and make sense of our intent and the world around usThe second is the emergence of a powerful new reasoning engine For years we\u2019ve digitized daily life places and things and organized them into databases But in a world rich with data what has been most scarce is our ability to reason over it This generation of AI helps us interact with data in powerful new ways\u2014from completing or summarizing text to detecting anomalies and recognizing images\u2014to help us identify patterns and surface insights faster than everTogether these two breakthroughs will unlock massive new opportunity And in fact just last month we announced our vision for Copilot an everyday AI companion We are building Copilot into all our most used products and experiences and allowing people to summon its power as a standalone app as well Just like you boot up an OS to access applications or use a browser to visit websites today our belief is that you will invoke a Copilot to do all those activities and more to shop to code to analyze to learn to createAs a company any time we approach a transition like this we do so responsibly We believe AI should be as empowering across communities as it is powerful and we\u2019re committed to ensuring it is responsibly built and designed with safety in mind from the outset OUR OPPORTUNITYEvery customer solution area and every layer of our tech stack will be reimagined for the AI era And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve already begun to doInfrastructureFour years ago we first invested in our AI supercomputer with a goal of building the best cloud for training and inference Today it\u2019s being used by our partner OpenAI to power its bestinclass foundation models and services including one of the fastestgrowing consumer apps ever\u2014ChatGPT NVIDIA as well as leading AI startups like Adept and Inflection is also using our infrastructure to build its own breakthrough models More broadly organizations continue to choose our ubiquitous computing fabric\u2014from cloud to edge\u2014to run their missioncritical applications We continued to see more cloud migrations to Azure this past fiscal year as it remains early when it comes to the longterm cloud opportunity And we also continue to lead in hybrid computing with Azure Arc which now has 18000 customers Data and AIEvery AI app starts with data and having a comprehensive data and analytics platform is more important than ever Our Intelligent Data Platform brings together operational databases analytics and governance so organizations can spend more time creating value and less time integrating their data estate We also introduced Microsoft Fabric this year which unifies compute storage and governance with a disruptive business modelWith Azure AI we are making foundation models available as platforms to our customers We offer the best selection of industryleading frontier and open models In January we made the Azure OpenAI Service broadly available bringing together advanced models including ChatGPT and GPT4 with the enterprise capabilities of Azure More than 11000 organizations across industries are already using it for advanced scenarios like content and code generation Meta chose us this summer as its preferred cloud to commercialize its Llama family of models And with Azure AI Studio we provide a full lifecycle toolchain customers can use to ground these models on their own data create prompt workflows and help ensure they are deployed and used safely Digital and app innovationGitHub Copilot is fundamentally transforming developer productivity helping developers complete coding tasks 55 percent faster More than 27000 organizations have chosen GitHub Copilot for Business and to date more than 1 million people have used GitHub Copilot to code faster We also announced our vision for the future of software development with GitHub Copilot X which will bring the power of AI throughout the entire software development lifecycle All up GitHub surpassed 1 billion in annual recurring revenue for the first time this fiscal year We\u2019re also applying AI across our lowcodenocode toolchain to help domain experts across an organization automate workflows create apps and webpages build virtual agents or analyze data using just natural language with copilots in Power Platform More than 63000 organizations have used AIpowered capabilities in Power Platform to dateBusiness applications We are bringing the next generation of AI to employees across every job function and every line of business with Dynamics 365 Copilot which works across CRM and ERP systems to reduce burdensome tasks like manual data entry content generation and notetaking In fact our own support agents are using Copilot in Dynamics 365 Customer Service to resolve more cases faster and without having to call on peers to help With our Supply Chain Platform we\u2019re helping customers apply AI to predict and mitigate disruptions And with our new Microsoft Sales Copilot sellers can infuse their customer interactions with data from CRM systems\u2014including both Salesforce and Dynamics\u2014to close more deals All up Dynamics surpassed 5 billion in revenue over the past fiscal year with our customer experience service and finance and supply chain businesses each surpassing 1 billion in annual salesIndustry Across industries we are rapidly becoming the partner of choice for any organization looking to generate real value from AI In healthcare for example we introduced the world\u2019s first fully automated clinical documentation application DAX Copilot The application helps physicians reduce documentation time by half freeing them to spend more time face to face with patients And Epic will integrate it directly into its electronic health records system And in retail we introduced new tools to help companies manage their daytoday operations and digitize their physical storesModern workWe are rapidly evolving Microsoft 365 into an AIfirst platform that enables every individual to amplify their creativity and productivity with both our established applications like Office and Teams as well as new apps like Designer Stream and Loop Microsoft 365 is designed for today\u2019s digitally connected distributed workforceThis year we also introduced a new pillar of customer value with Microsoft 365 Copilot which combines nextgeneration AI with business data in the Microsoft Graph and Microsoft 365 applications to help people be more productive and unleash their creativity at work Just last month I was excited to announce that we will make Microsoft 365 Copilot generally available to our commercial customers later this yearWe continue to build momentum in Microsoft Teams across collaboration chat meetings and calls We introduced a new version of Teams that delivers up to two times faster performance while using 50 percent less memory We also introduced Teams Premium to meet enterprise demand for AIpowered features like intelligent meeting recaps All up Teams usage surpassed 300

advertising and newsWe are reshaping daily search and web habits with our new Bing and Microsoft Edge browser which brings together search browsing chat and AI into one unified experience to deliver better search more complete answers a new chat experience and the ability to generate content We think of these tools as an AI copilot for the web We are also bringing these breakthrough capabilities to businesses with Bing Chat Enterprise which offers commercial data protection providing an easy onramp for any organization looking to get the benefit of nextgeneration AI today Although it\u2019s early in our journey Bing users engaged in more than 1 billion chats and created more than 750 million images over the past year as they apply these new tools to get things done And Edge has taken share for nine consecutive quartersMore broadly we continue to expand our opportunity in advertising This year Netflix chose us as its exclusive technology and sales partner for its first adsupported subscription offering a validation of the differentiated value we provide to any publisher looking for a flexible partner to build and innovate with themLinkedInThe excitement around AI is creating new opportunities across every function\u2014from marketing sales service and finance to software development and security And LinkedIn is increasingly where people are going to learn discuss and uplevel their skills We are using AI to help our members and customers connect to opportunities and tap into the experiences of experts on the platform In fact our AIpowered articles are already the fastestgrowing traffic driver to the networkAll up LinkedIn\u2019s revenue surpassed 15 billion for the first time this fiscal year a testament to how mission critical the platform has become to help more than 950 million members connect learn sell and get hiredGamingIn gaming we are rapidly executing on our ambition to be the first choice for people to play great games whenever wherever and however they want With Xbox Game Pass we are redefining how games are distributed played and viewed Content is the flywheel behind the service\u2019s growth and our pipeline has never been stronger It was especially energizing to release Starfield this fall to broad acclaim with more than 10 million players in the first month postlaunch aloneEarlier this month we were thrilled to close our acquisition of Activision Blizzard and we look forward to sharing more in the coming months about how together we will bring the joy of gaming to more people around the worldDevices and creativityFinally we\u2019re turning Windows into a powerful new AI canvas with Copilot which rolled out as part of a Windows 11 update last month It uniquely incorporates the context and intelligence of the web your work data and what you are doing in the moment on your PC to provide better assistance while keeping your privacy and security at the forefront Overall the number of devices running Windows 11 more than doubled in the past year And we are also transforming how Windows is experienced and managed with Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365 which together surpassed 1 billion in annual revenue for the first timeOUR RESPONSIBILITYAs we pursue our opportunity we are also working to ensure technology helps us solve problems\u2014not create new ones To do this we focus on four enduring commitments that are central to our mission and that take on even greater importance in this new era For us these commitments are more than just words They\u2019re a guide to help us make decisions across everything we do\u2014as we design and develop products shape business processes and policies help our customers thrive build partnerships and more \u2014always asking ourselves critical questions to ensure our actions are aligned with themHow can we expand opportunityFirst we believe access to economic growth and opportunity should reach every person organization community and country And although AI can serve as a catalyst for opportunity and growth we must first ensure everyone has access to the technologies data and skills they need to benefitTo achieve this we are focused on getting technology into the hands of nonprofits social entrepreneurs and other civil society organizations to help them digitally transform so they can help address some of society\u2019s biggest challenges This year we provided nonprofits with over 38 billion in discounted and donated technology Nearly 325000 nonprofits used our cloud And to help them tap the potential of AI we\u2019re building new AI capabilities for fundraising marketing and program deliveryAI will displace some jobs but it will also create new ones That\u2019s why we aim to train and certify 10 million people by 2025 with the skills for jobs and livelihoods in an increasingly digital economy Since July 2020 we\u2019ve helped 85 million people including 27 million this year We\u2019ve also focused on skilling women and underrepresented communities in cybersecurity working across 28 countries and with nearly 400 US community colleges to scale our effortsFinally to help people learn more about AI we launched the first online Professional Certificate on Generative AI in partnership with LinkedIn Learning created AI tools for educators and held our first AI Community Learning event in the US These events will be replicated around the world and localized in 10 languages over the next year We also partnered to launch a Generative AI Skills Grant Challenge to explore how nonprofit social enterprise and research or academic institutions can empower the workforce to use this new generation of AIHow can we earn trust To create positive impact with technology people need to be able to trust the technologies they use and the companies behind them For us earning trust spans the responsible use of AI protecting privacy and advancing digital safety and cybersecurity  Our commitment to responsible AI is not new Since 2017 we\u2019ve worked to develop our responsible AI practice recognizing that trust is never given but earned through action We have translated our AI principles into a core set of implementation processes as well as tools training and practices to support compliance But internal programs aren\u2019t enough We also enable our customers and partners to develop and deploy AI safely including through our AI customer commitments and services like Azure AI Studio with its content safety tooling and access to our Responsible AI dashboard Building AI responsibly requires that we work with other industry leaders civil society and governments to advocate for AI regulations and governance globally This year we released our Governing AI Blueprint which outlines concrete legal and policy recommendations for AI guardrails We are signatories to the eight voluntary commitments developed with the US White House and proud of the six additional commitments we\u2019ve made to further strengthen and operationalize the principles of safety security and trust The era of AI heightens the importance of cybersecurity and we deepened our work across the private and public sectors to improve cyberresilience We\u2019ve continued to support Ukraine in defending critical infrastructure detecting and disrupting cyberattacks and cyberinfluence operations and providing intelligence related to these attacks Our Microsoft Threat Analysis Center team produced more than 500 intelligence reports to help keep customers and the public informed And we published our third annual Microsoft Digital Defense Report sharing our learnings and security recommendations We also remain committed to creating safe experiences online and protecting customers from illegal and harmful content and conduct while respecting human rights We supported the Christchurch Call Initiative on Algorithmic Outcomes to address terrorist and violent and extremist content online And through the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Coalition for Digital Safety we coled the development of new global principles for digital safety Protecting customers\u2019 privacy and giving them control of their data is more important than ever We\u2019ve begun our phased rollout of the EU Data Boundary supporting our commercial and public sector customers\u2019 need for data sovereignty And each month more than 3 million people exercise their data protection rights through our privacy dashboard making meaningful choices about how their data is used How can we protect fundamental rightsIn an increasingly digital world we have a responsibility to promote and protect people\u2019s fundamental rights and address the challenges technology creates For us this means upholding responsible business practices expanding connectivity and accessibility advancing fair and inclusive societies and empowering communities In 2023 we worked diligently to anticipate harmful uses of our technology and put guardrails on the use of technologies that are consequential to people\u2019s lives or legal status create risk of harm or threaten human rights We will continue to assess the impact of our technologies engage our stakeholders and model and adopt responsible practices and respect for human rights\u2014including across our global supply chainToday our lives are more connected than ever Access to education employment healthcare and other critical services is increasingly dependent on technology That\u2019s why we\u2019ve expanded our commitment to bring access to affordable highspeed internet to a quarter of a billion people around the world including 100 million people in Africa by the end of 2025 Since 2017 we\u2019ve helped bring internet access to 63 million people a key first step to ensuring communities will have access to AI and other digital technologies This year we also continued working toward our fiveyear commitment to bridge the disability divide with a focus on helping close the accessibility knowledge gap Seven hundred and fiftythousand learners enriched their understanding of disability and accessibility in partnership with LinkedIn Learning Teach Access and the Microsoft disability community In addition we\u2019re stepping up efforts to combat online disinformation through new media content provenance technologies\u2014enabling users to verify if an image or video was generated by AI We continued our efforts to promote racial equity across Microsoft our ecosystem and our communities including our work to advance justice reform through datadriven insights And we provided support in response to eight humanitarian disasters including committing 540 million of support to those who have been impacted by the War in Ukraine Finally recognizing AI\u2019s potential to advance human rights and humanitarian action we worked on several AI for Humanitarian Action projects Together with our partners we\u2019re building the capabilities to identify atrisk communities estimate seasonal hunger predict malnutrition and assist in disease identification How can we advance sustainabilityClimate change is the defining issue of our generation and addressing it requires swift collective action and technological innovation We are committed to meeting our own goals while enabling others to do the same That means taking responsibility for our operational footprint and accelerating progress through technology We continue to see extreme weather impacting communities globally To meet the urgent need this must be a decade of innovation and decisive action\u2014for Microsoft our customers and the world In our latest Environmental Sustainability Report we shared our progress toward our 2030 sustainability targets across carbon water waste and ecosystems In 2022 our overall carbon emissions declined by 05 percent while our business grew Addressing scope 3 emissions which account for the vast majority of our emissions is arguably our ultimate challenge\u2014one we\u2019ll continue to tackle through our supply chain policy advances and industrywide knowledgesharingWe\u2019ve provided just under 1 million people with access to clean water and sanitation one of five pillars on our path to becoming water positive And in our pursuit to be zero waste we achieved a reuse and recycle rate of 82 percent for all our cloud hardware and diverted over 12000 metric tons of solid operational waste from landfills and incinerators We also continue to take responsibility for the impacts of our direct operations on Earth\u2019s ecosystems We\u2019ve contracted to protect 17268 acres of land over 50 percent more than the land we use to operate Of that 12270 acres\u2014the equivalent of approximately 7000 soccer fields\u2014were designated as permanently protected Technology is a powerful lever to help us avoid the most severe impacts of climate change That\u2019s why we\u2019re accelerating our investment in more efficient datacenters clean energy enhancements to the Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability and Planetary Computer and green software practices To date through our Climate Innovation Fund we\u2019ve allocated more than 700 million to a global portfolio of 50 investments spanning sustainable solutions in energy industrial and natural systems Finally we believe AI can be a powerful accelerant in addressing the climate crisis We expanded our AI for Good Lab in Egypt and Kenya to improve climate resilience for the continent And together with our partners we launched Global Renewables Watch a firstofitskind living atlas that aims to map and measure utilityscale solar and wind installations allowing users to evaluate progress toward a clean energy transition Although this new era promises great opportunity it demands even greater responsibility from companies like ours As we pursue our four commitments we focus on transparency\u2014providing clear reporting on how we run our business and how we work with customers and partners Our annual Impact Summary shares more about our progress and learnings this year and our Reports Hub provides detailed reports on our environmental data political activities workforce demographics human rights work and more OUR CULTUREThere\u2019s never been a more important time to live our culture The way we work and the speed at which we work are changing In an economy where yesterday\u2019s exceptional is today\u2019s expected all of us at Microsoft will need to embrace a growth mindset and more importantly confront our fixed mindsets as our culture evolves It will take everyday courage to reformulate what innovation business models and sales motions look like in this new era As a highperformance organization we aspire to help our employees maximize their economic opportunity while simultaneously helping them learn and grow professionally and connect their own passion and purpose with their everyday work and the company\u2019s missionTo be successful we need to be grounded in what our customers and the world need We need to innovate and collaborate as One Microsoft And we need to actively seek diversity and embrace inclusion to best serve our customers and create a culture where everyone can do their best work To empower the world we need to represent the world To that end we remain focused on increasing representation and strengthening our culture of inclusion Even as we navigated challenges this year our company continued to be the most globally diverse it\u2019s ever been Giving also remains core to our culture This year more than 105000 employees gave 242 million including company match to over 35000 nonprofits in 116 countries And our employees volunteered over 930000 hours to causes they care aboutI am deeply grateful to our employees for their commitment to the company and their communities and how they are living our mission and culture every day in a changing company and worldIn closing this is Microsoft\u2019s moment We have an incredible opportunity to use this new era of AI to deliver meaningful benefits for every person and every organization on the planet On New Year\u2019s Day I saw a tweet from Andrej Karpathy Tesla\u2019s former director of AI who now works at OpenAI about how GitHub Copilot was writing about 80 percent of his code with 80 percent accuracy Two days later I saw a stunning example of work we\u2019ve done with the government of India\u2019s Ministry of Electronics and IT which is applying an AI model so farmers in rural areas can interact with government resources in their native languages Think about that A foundation model that was developed on the West Coast of the United States is already transforming the lives of both elite developers and rural farmers on the other side of the globe We\u2019ve not seen this speed of diffusion and breadth of impact in the tech industry beforeAs a company this is our moment to show up and responsibly build solutions that drive economic growth and benefit every community country industry and person If we do it well the world will do well and Microsoft will do well too I\u2019ve never been more confident that we will deliver on this promise together in the days months and years to come

ongoing economic social and geopolitical volatility At the same time we have entered a new age of AI that will fundamentally transform productivity for every individual organization and industry on earth and help us address some of our most pressing challengesThis next generation of AI will reshape every software category and every business including our own Fortyeight years after its founding Microsoft remains a consequential company because time and time again\u2014from PCServer to WebInternet to CloudMobile\u2014we have adapted to technological paradigm shifts Today we are doing so once again as we lead this new eraAmid this transformation our mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more remains constant As a company we believe we can be the democratizing force for this new generation of technology and the opportunity it will help unlock for every country community and individual while mitigating its risksHere are just a few examples of how we are already doing this\u2022\tLeading electronic health records vendor Epic is addressing some of the biggest challenges facing the healthcare industry today\u2014including physician burnout\u2014by deploying a wide range of copilot solutions built on Azure OpenAI Service and Dragon Ambient eXperience Copilot\u2022\tMercado Libre is reducing the time its developers spend writing code by more than 50 percent with GitHub Copilot as the company works to democratize ecommerce across Latin America\u2022\tMercedesBenz is making its incar voice assistant more intuitive for hundreds of thousands of drivers using ChatGPT via the Azure OpenAI Service \u2022\tLumen Technologies is helping its employees be more productive enabling them to focus on higher valueadded activities by deploying Microsoft 365 Copilot\u2022\tNonprofit The Contingent is matching foster families with children in need using Dynamics 365 Power BI and Azure with an eye on using AI to amplify its work across the US\u2022\tAnd Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of Education has built an online platform to help elementary and high school students learn English using Azure AITo build on this progress we remain convicted on three things First we will maintain our lead as the top commercial cloud while innovating in consumer categories from gaming to professional social networks Second because we know that maximum enterprise value gets created during platform shifts like this one we will invest to accelerate our lead in AI by infusing this technology across every layer of the tech stack And finally we will continue to drive operating leverage aligning our cost structure with our revenue growthAs we make progress on these priorities we delivered strong results in fiscal year 2023 including a record 211 billion in revenue and over 88 billion in operating income A NEW ERA OF AIThere are two breakthroughs coming together to define this new era of AI The first is the most universal interface natural language The long arc of computing has in many ways been shaped by the pursuit of increasingly intuitive humancomputer interfaces\u2014keyboards mice touch screens We believe we have now arrived at the next big step forward\u2014natural language\u2014and will quickly go beyond to see hear interpret and make sense of our intent and the world around usThe second is the emergence of a powerful new reasoning engine For years we\u2019ve digitized daily life places and things and organized them into databases But in a world rich with data what has been most scarce is our ability to reason over it This generation of AI helps us interact with data in powerful new ways\u2014from completing or summarizing text to detecting anomalies and recognizing images\u2014to help us identify patterns and surface insights faster than everTogether these two breakthroughs will unlock massive new opportunity And in fact just last month we announced our vision for Copilot an everyday AI companion We are building Copilot into all our most used products and experiences and allowing people to summon its power as a standalone app as well Just like you boot up an OS to access applications or use a browser to visit websites today our belief is that you will invoke a Copilot to do all those activities and more to shop to code to analyze to learn to createAs a company any time we approach a transition like this we do so responsibly We believe AI should be as empowering across communities as it is powerful and we\u2019re committed to ensuring it is responsibly built and designed with safety in mind from the outset OUR OPPORTUNITYEvery customer solution area and every layer of our tech stack will be reimagined for the AI era And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve already begun to doInfrastructureFour years ago we first invested in our AI supercomputer with a goal of building the best cloud for training and inference Today it\u2019s being used by our partner OpenAI to power its bestinclass foundation models and services including one of the fastestgrowing consumer apps ever\u2014ChatGPT NVIDIA as well as leading AI startups like Adept and Inflection is also using our infrastructure to build its own breakthrough models More broadly organizations continue to choose our ubiquitous computing fabric\u2014from cloud to edge\u2014to run their missioncritical applications We continued to see more cloud migrations to Azure this past fiscal year as it remains early when it comes to the longterm cloud opportunity And we also continue to lead in hybrid computing with Azure Arc which now has 18000 customers Data and AIEvery AI app starts with data and having a comprehensive data and analytics platform is more important than ever Our Intelligent Data Platform brings together operational databases analytics and governance so organizations can spend more time creating value and less time integrating their data estate We also introduced Microsoft Fabric this year which unifies compute storage and governance with a disruptive business modelWith Azure AI we are making foundation models available as platforms to our customers We offer the best selection of industryleading frontier and open models In January we made the Azure OpenAI Service broadly available bringing together advanced models including ChatGPT and GPT4 with the enterprise capabilities of Azure More than 11000 organizations across industries are already using it for advanced scenarios like content and code generation Meta chose us this summer as its preferred cloud to commercialize its Llama family of models And with Azure AI Studio we provide a full lifecycle toolchain customers can use to ground these models on their own data create prompt workflows and help ensure they are deployed and used safely Digital and app innovationGitHub Copilot is fundamentally transforming developer productivity helping developers complete coding tasks 55 percent faster More than 27000 organizations have chosen GitHub Copilot for Business and to date more than 1 million people have used GitHub Copilot to code faster We also announced our vision for the future of software development with GitHub Copilot X which will bring the power of AI throughout the entire software development lifecycle All up GitHub surpassed 1 billion in annual recurring revenue for the first time this fiscal year We\u2019re also applying AI across our lowcodenocode toolchain to help domain experts across an organization automate workflows create apps and webpages build virtual agents or analyze data using just natural language with copilots in Power Platform More than 63000 organizations have used AIpowered capabilities in Power Platform to dateBusiness applications We are bringing the next generation of AI to employees across every job function and every line of business with Dynamics 365 Copilot which works across CRM and ERP systems to reduce burdensome tasks like manual data entry content

Chain Platform we\u2019re helping customers apply AI to predict and mitigate disruptions And with our new Microsoft Sales Copilot sellers can infuse their customer interactions with data from CRM systems\u2014including both Salesforce and Dynamics\u2014to close more deals All up Dynamics surpassed 5 billion in revenue over the past fiscal year with our customer experience service and finance and supply chain businesses each surpassing 1 billion in annual salesIndustry Across industries we are rapidly becoming the partner of choice for any organization looking to generate real value from AI In healthcare for example we introduced the world\u2019s first fully automated clinical documentation application DAX Copilot The application helps physicians reduce documentation time by half freeing them to spend more time face to face with patients And Epic will integrate it directly into its electronic health records system And in retail we introduced new tools to help companies manage their daytoday operations and digitize their physical storesModern workWe are rapidly evolving Microsoft 365 into an AIfirst platform that enables every individual to amplify their creativity and productivity with both our established applications like Office and Teams as well as new apps like Designer Stream and Loop Microsoft 365 is designed for today\u2019s digitally connected distributed workforceThis year we also introduced a new pillar of customer value with Microsoft 365 Copilot which combines nextgeneration AI with business data in the Microsoft Graph and Microsoft 365 applications to help people be more productive and unleash their creativity at work Just last month I was excited to announce that we will make Microsoft 365 Copilot generally available to our commercial customers later this yearWe continue to build momentum in Microsoft Teams across collaboration chat meetings and calls We introduced a new version of Teams that delivers up to two times

however they want With Xbox Game Pass we are redefining how games are distributed played and viewed Content is the flywheel behind the service\u2019s growth and our pipeline has never been stronger It was especially energizing to release Starfield this fall to broad acclaim with more than 10 million players in the first month postlaunch aloneEarlier this month we were thrilled to close our acquisition of Activision Blizzard and we look forward to sharing more in the coming months about how together we will bring the joy of gaming to more people around the worldDevices and creativityFinally we\u2019re turning Windows into a powerful new AI canvas with Copilot which rolled out as part of a Windows 11 update last month It uniquely incorporates the context and intelligence of the web your work data and what you are doing in the moment on your PC to provide better assistance while keeping your privacy and security at the forefront Overall the number of devices running Windows 11 more than doubled in the past year And we are also transforming how Windows is experienced and managed with Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365 which together surpassed 1 billion in annual revenue for the first timeOUR RESPONSIBILITYAs we pursue our opportunity we are also working to ensure technology helps us solve problems\u2014not create new ones To do this we focus on four enduring commitments that are central to our mission and that take on even greater importance in this new era For us these commitments are more than just words They\u2019re a guide to help us make decisions across everything we do\u2014as we design and develop products shape business processes and policies help our customers thrive build partnerships and more \u2014always asking ourselves critical questions to ensure our actions are aligned with themHow can we expand opportunityFirst we believe access to economic growth and opportunity should reach every person organization community and country And although AI can serve as a catalyst for opportunity and growth we must first ensure everyone has access to the technologies data and skills they need to benefitTo achieve this we are focused on getting technology into the hands of nonprofits social entrepreneurs and other civil society organizations to help them digitally transform so they can help address some of society\u2019s biggest challenges This year we provided nonprofits with over 38 billion in discounted and donated technology Nearly 325000 nonprofits used our cloud And to help them tap the potential of AI we\u2019re building new AI capabilities for fundraising marketing and program deliveryAI will displace some jobs but it will also create new ones That\u2019s why we aim to train and certify 10 million people by 2025 with the skills for jobs and livelihoods in an increasingly digital economy Since July 2020 we\u2019ve helped 85 million people including 27 million this year We\u2019ve also focused on skilling women and underrepresented communities in cybersecurity working across 28 countries and with nearly 400 US community colleges to scale our effortsFinally to help people learn more about AI we launched the first online Professional Certificate on Generative AI in partnership with LinkedIn Learning created AI tools for educators and held our first AI Community Learning event in the US These events will be replicated around the world and localized in 10 languages over the next year We also partnered to launch a Generative AI Skills Grant Challenge to explore how nonprofit social enterprise and research or academic institutions can empower the workforce to use this new generation of AIHow can we earn trust To create positive impact with technology people need to be able to trust the technologies they use and the companies behind them For us earning trust spans the responsible use of AI protecting privacy and advancing digital safety and cybersecurity  Our commitment to responsible AI is not new Since 2017 we\u2019ve worked to develop our responsible AI practice recognizing that trust is never given but earned through action We have translated our AI principles into a core set of implementation processes as well as tools training and practices to support compliance But internal programs aren\u2019t enough We also enable our customers and partners to develop and deploy AI safely including through our AI customer commitments and services like Azure AI Studio with its content safety tooling and access to our Responsible AI dashboard Building AI responsibly requires that we work with other industry leaders civil society and governments to advocate for AI regulations and governance globally This year we released our Governing AI Blueprint which outlines concrete legal and policy recommendations for AI guardrails We are signatories to the eight voluntary commitments developed with the US White House and proud of the six additional commitments we\u2019ve made to further strengthen and operationalize the principles of safety security and trust The era of AI heightens the importance of cybersecurity and we deepened our work across the private and public sectors to improve cyberresilience We\u2019ve continued to support Ukraine in defending critical infrastructure detecting and disrupting cyberattacks and cyberinfluence operations and providing intelligence related to these attacks Our Microsoft Threat Analysis Center team produced more than 500 intelligence reports to help keep customers and the public informed And we published our third annual Microsoft Digital Defense Report sharing our learnings and security recommendations We also remain committed to creating safe experiences online and protecting customers from illegal and harmful content and conduct while respecting human rights We supported the Christchurch Call Initiative on Algorithmic Outcomes to address terrorist and violent and extremist content online And through the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Coalition for Digital Safety we coled the development of new global principles for digital safety Protecting customers\u2019 privacy and giving them control of their data is more important than ever We\u2019ve begun our phased rollout of the EU Data Boundary supporting our commercial and public sector customers\u2019 need for data sovereignty And each month more than 3 million people exercise their data protection rights through our privacy dashboard making meaningful choices about how their data is used How can we protect fundamental rightsIn an increasingly digital world we have a responsibility to promote and protect people\u2019s fundamental rights and address the challenges technology creates For us this means upholding responsible business practices expanding connectivity and accessibility advancing fair and inclusive societies and empowering communities In 2023 we worked diligently to anticipate harmful uses of our technology and put guardrails on the use of technologies that are consequential to people\u2019s lives or legal status create risk of harm or threaten human rights We will continue to assess the impact of our technologies engage our stakeholders and model and adopt responsible practices and respect for human rights\u2014including across our global supply chainToday our lives are more connected than ever Access to education employment healthcare and other critical services is increasingly dependent on technology That\u2019s why we\u2019ve expanded our commitment to bring access to affordable highspeed internet to a quarter of a billion people around the world including 100 million people in Africa by the end of 2025 Since 2017 we\u2019ve helped bring internet access to 63 million people a key first step to ensuring communities will have access to AI and other digital technologies This year we also continued working toward our fiveyear commitment to bridge the disability divide with a focus on helping close the accessibility knowledge gap Seven hundred and fiftythousand learners enriched their understanding of disability and accessibility in partnership with LinkedIn Learning Teach Access and the Microsoft disability community In addition we\u2019re stepping up efforts to combat online disinformation through new media content provenance technologies\u2014enabling users to verify if an image or video was generated by AI We continued our efforts to promote racial equity across Microsoft our ecosystem and our communities including our work to advance justice reform through datadriven insights And we provided support in response to eight humanitarian disasters including committing 540 million of support to those who have been impacted by the War in Ukraine Finally recognizing AI\u2019s potential to advance human rights and humanitarian action we worked on several AI for Humanitarian Action projects Together with our partners we\u2019re building the capabilities to identify atrisk communities estimate seasonal hunger predict malnutrition and assist in disease identification How can we advance sustainabilityClimate change is the defining issue of our generation and addressing it requires swift collective action and technological innovation We are committed to meeting our own goals while enabling others to do the same That means taking responsibility for our operational footprint and accelerating progress through technology We continue to see extreme weather impacting communities globally To meet the urgent need this must be a decade of innovation and decisive action\u2014for Microsoft our customers and the world In our latest Environmental Sustainability Report we shared our progress toward our 2030 sustainability targets across carbon water waste and ecosystems In 2022 our overall carbon emissions declined by 05 percent while our business grew Addressing scope 3 emissions which account for the vast majority of our emissions is arguably our ultimate challenge\u2014one we\u2019ll continue to tackle through our supply chain policy advances and industrywide knowledgesharingWe\u2019ve provided just under 1 million people with access to clean water and sanitation one of five pillars on our path to becoming water positive And in our pursuit to be zero waste we achieved a reuse and recycle rate of 82 percent for all our cloud hardware and diverted over 12000 metric tons of solid operational waste from landfills and incinerators We also continue to take responsibility for the impacts of our direct operations on Earth\u2019s ecosystems We\u2019ve contracted to protect 17268 acres of land over 50 percent more than the land we use to operate Of that 12270 acres\u2014the equivalent of approximately 7000 soccer fields\u2014were designated as permanently protected Technology is a powerful lever to help us avoid the most severe impacts of climate change That\u2019s why we\u2019re accelerating our investment in more efficient datacenters clean energy enhancements to the Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability and Planetary Computer and green software practices To date through our Climate Innovation Fund we\u2019ve allocated more than 700 million to a global portfolio of 50 investments spanning sustainable solutions in energy industrial and natural systems Finally we believe AI can be a powerful accelerant in addressing the climate crisis We expanded our AI for Good Lab in Egypt and Kenya to improve climate resilience for the continent And together with our partners we launched Global Renewables Watch a firstofitskind living atlas that aims to map and measure utilityscale solar and wind installations allowing users to evaluate progress toward a clean energy transition Although this new era promises great opportunity it demands even greater responsibility from companies like ours As we pursue our four commitments we focus on transparency\u2014providing clear reporting on how we run our business and how we work with customers and partners Our annual Impact Summary shares more about our progress and learnings this year and our Reports Hub provides detailed reports on our environmental data political activities workforce demographics human rights work and more OUR CULTUREThere\u2019s never been a more important time to live our culture The way we work and the speed at which we work are changing In an economy where yesterday\u2019s exceptional is today\u2019s expected all of us at Microsoft will need to embrace a growth mindset and more importantly confront our fixed mindsets as our culture evolves It will take everyday courage to reformulate what innovation business models and sales motions look like in this new era As a highperformance organization we aspire to help our employees maximize their economic opportunity while simultaneously helping them learn and grow professionally and connect their own passion and purpose with their everyday work and the company\u2019s missionTo be successful we need to be grounded in what our customers and the world need We need to innovate and collaborate as One Microsoft And we need to actively seek diversity and embrace inclusion to best serve our customers and create a culture where everyone can do their best work To empower the world we need to represent the world To that end we remain focused on increasing representation and strengthening our culture of inclusion Even as we navigated challenges this year our company continued to be the most globally diverse it\u2019s ever been Giving also remains core to our culture This year more than 105000 employees gave 242 million including company match to over 35000 nonprofits in 116 countries And our employees volunteered over 930000 hours to causes they care aboutI am deeply grateful to our employees for their commitment to the company and their communities and how they are living our mission and culture every day in a changing company and worldIn closing this is Microsoft\u2019s moment We have an incredible opportunity to use this new era of AI to deliver meaningful benefits for every person and every organization on the planet On New Year\u2019s Day I saw a tweet from Andrej Karpathy Tesla\u2019s former director of AI who now works at OpenAI about how GitHub Copilot was writing about 80 percent of his code with 80 percent accuracy Two days later I saw a stunning example of work we\u2019ve done with the government of India\u2019s Ministry of Electronics and IT which is applying an AI model so farmers in rural areas can interact with government resources in their native languages Think about that A foundation model that was developed on the West Coast of the United States is already transforming the lives of both elite developers and rural farmers on the other side of the globe We\u2019ve not seen this speed of diffusion and breadth of impact in the tech industry beforeAs a company this is our moment to show up and responsibly build solutions that drive economic growth and benefit every community country industry and person If we do it well the world will do well and Microsoft will do well too I\u2019ve never been more confident that we will deliver on this promise together in the days months and years to come

Throughout 2022 Evernorth Health Services continued to drive a digitalfirst approach to care with MDLIVE serving as the engine for virtual care Last year alone total MDLIVE patient visits grew by approximately 20 percent4 including substantial growth in the virtual primary care program we introduced Today MDLIVE offers virtual primary urgent behavioral and dermatological care which is expanding access enhancing experiences and improving affordability for customers Evernorth Health Services\u2019 pharmacy solutions are also increasing the value of each dollar spent on medication and driving to the lowest net cost while ensuring quality outcomes The highest therapy completion rates in the market are a key part of this success This applies to specialty and gene therapy costs which comprise as much as half of total drug spending5 even though specialty drugs are used by less than 2 percent of the population Biosimilars offer growing opportunities to lower costs for patients clients and partners and our leading specialty pharmacy capabilities give us a differentiated position to create value Today approximately 7 percent of our specialty drug spend has a biosimilar or generic equivalent on the market and this will likely increase to more than 25 percent by 20264 Over time we believe this will translate to a 100 billion market opportunity6 And we expect to manage almost 30 billion of this market opportunity driving significant savings for patients and clients as more biosimilar equivalents come to market4 As a result of the value Evernorth Health Services is generating for the benefit of those we serve we continue to be a partner of choice across health care and have established significant new relationships with Kaiser Permanente7 and Centene8 Pharmacy

demonstrated significant progress on our three strategic pillars and we delivered on our commitments to performance optimization and value creation Executing on our operating commercial and financial objectives combined with a strong macroeconomic environment led to superior total shareholder returns in 2022 of 87 At the same time we continued to deepen our environmental social and governance ESG efforts to drive longterm benefits for our business and stakeholders In 2022 we leveraged structural improvements we made in our commercial and operational execution to meet robust customer demand and capture strong margin opportunities Our commitment to safe reliable and environmentally sound operations enabled us to run our refining system at 96 utilization for the year which included operating at full utilization in the second quarter when demand for the transportation fuels we manufacture was highest MPC generated 164 billion of cash from operations in 2022 We returned nearly 12 billion to shareholders through share repurchases during the year bringing total repurchases between May 2021 and the end of 2022 to almost 17 billion Demonstrating our commitment to a secure competitive and growing dividend in November we increased MPC\u2019s quarterly dividend by 30 Challenging ourselves to lead in sustainable energy we made significant progress on our Martinez Renewables facility and further optimized our Dickinson Renewables facility we added two substantial 2030 goals to our emissions reduction targets and we set a new industry record for the number of refineries certified for superior energy efficiency performance in one year through the US Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s EPA ENERGY STAR\u00ae program MPC 2022 ANNUAL REPORT 1 DEVELOPING ENDURING CAPABILITIES In early 2020 we introduced our three strategic pillars strengthening the competitive position of our assets fostering a lowcost culture and improving our commercial performance Since then they have become a foundational part of MPC\u2019s DNA aligning our efforts to increase profitability and drive longterm value creation We continue to be committed to these three strategic pillars today because they address foundational aspects of our business that are within our control While there is more to do I am very proud of our progress in these areas which was reflected in our 2022 performance We\u2019ve achieved and sustained cost reductions while never compromising the safety of our employees or assets made purposeful moves to strengthen our portfolio and implemented commercial and operational improvements that can deliver incremental value into the future Importantly while we\u2019ve positioned ourselves for the future over the last few years we\u2019ve remained grounded in our Core Values which guide us to hold steadfast in our commitment to safe and environmentally responsible operations to find and create shared value and to set and hold ourselves accountable to high expectations STRENGTHENING THE COMPETITIVE POSITION OF OUR ASSETS In September we completed the formation of our Martinez Renewables joint venture with Neste which enhances the value of the project to convert our idled Martinez California refinery into a renewable fuels facility The facility is expected to ramp up to produce 730 million gallons per year of renewable fuels by the end of 2023 with pretreatment capabilities expected to come online midyear 2023 At our Dickinson North Dakota renewable diesel facility we optimized operations to accommodate more advantaged feedstocks which lower the carbon intensity of the fuels we produce and further improve its economic potential In midstream segment adjusted EBITDA grew 7 year over year and the strength and stability of our logistics capabilities helped us navigate market fluctuations MPLX advanced several organic growth projects in the Permian Basin and remained a source of growing distributions for MPC and other unitholders In November MPLX raised its quarterly distribution by 10 At this current level MPC is expected to receive approximately 2 billion of annual distributions from MPLX CONTINUED CAPITAL AND COST DISCIPLINE Our success embedding a lowcost culture across the company enabled us to sustain our previously achieved 15 billion of structural cost reduction We remain focused on achieving operational excellence by reducing costs within our control improving efficiency driving operational improvements and being disciplined in capital allocation We also worked hard to mitigate higher energy input costs throughout the year and we believe our sustained structural cost reductions help us to more readily adapt to market fluctuations We continue to build upon our Focus on Energy FOE program which uses key performance indicators to guide energy management and promote energy efficiency across our refineries In 2022 FOErelated initiatives led to more than 50 million in energy cost savings for the year while avoiding 31700 metric tons of carbon dioxideequivalent emissions per month IMPROVING COMMERCIAL PERFORMANCE Over the past 18 months we have meaningfully changed our commercial approach across the company and strengthened our teams To unlock value we have empowered our people to optimize across our integrated system more effectively leverage our scale and proximity to key supply sources and demand hubs and improve product placement A nearterm focus has been securing advantaged renewable feedstocks as we continue to advance our renewable fuels production capabilities This includes exploring joint venture opportunities and strategic alliances within the renewable fuels value chain as well as looking to expand upon the partnerships we\u2019ve built with Neste and ADM In June our Green Bison Soy Processing joint venture with ADM began construction of North Dakota\u2019s first dedicated soybean processing plant By the seasonal harvest of 2023 it is expected to begin supplying approximately 600 million pounds a year of locally advantaged refined soybean oil exclusively to MPC helping us further optimize feedstock sourcing for renewable diesel production at our Dickinson facility We continued to progress our Galveston Bay STAR project which we expect to complete in the first quarter of 2023 The remaining scope of this strategic project is targeted to increase crude oil processing capacity by 40000 barrels per calendar day improve residual upgrading capacity by 17000 barrels per calendar day enhance diesel recovery and enable the facility to process more advantaged crude oil OUR PATH TO LEADING IN SUSTAINABLE ENERGY Across our integrated system we are meeting the energy needs of today while investing in an energydiverse future Our approach to sustainability which we apply across the components of ESG is key to our success in this effort We continue to focus on positioning MPC to lead in an energydiverse world by strengthening the resiliency of our business through reducing our carbon footprint and conserving natural resources innovating for the future by investing in renewables and emerging technologies and embedding sustainability in decisionmaking and in how we engage our stakeholders To help drive advancement we have set meaningful targets to reduce greenhouse gas GHG emissions methane emissions and freshwater intensity We believe our continued progress demonstrates a tangible FROM THE PRESIDENT AND CEO 2 MPC 2022 ANNUAL REPORT path to achieving these milestones In 2022 we established a goal to reduce our absolute Scope 3 category 11 GHG emissions to 15 below 2019 levels by 2030 becoming the first large downstream company to set an absolute Scope 3 target We also expanded our existing goal for reducing methane emissions intensity across our natural gas gathering and processing business creating a new longrange target of lowering intensity 75 from 2016 levels by 2030 Similarly to ensure we have the diversity of thought necessary to shape our future we continue to include a diversity equity and inclusion DEI component in the metrics that determine our annual bonus compensation Established in 2021 we were the first US independent refiner to link a DEI metric to executive and employee compensation We also remain focused on being a good neighbor in our communities through meaningful relationships with key stakeholders to understand needs and concerns define priorities and pursue shared goals In 2022 the company invested more than 20 million in the communities where we live and work as well as in the broader causes that united many of us and our employees contributed more than 4 million in additional support We continue to allocate significant growth capital to low carbon projects particularly around increasing our production of renewable fuels and natural gas In fact MPC is projected to become one of the largest global producers of renewable diesel in early 2024 and MPLX assets currently process about 10 of the natural gas in the United States MPC and MPLX are also actively involved in publicprivate alliances to explore and develop pathways for emerging opportunities around carbon capture utilization and sequestration CCUS as well as hydrogen energy production and utilization LOOKING FORWARD in 2023 I\u2019m more optimistic than ever about MPC\u2019s evolving role in meeting the world\u2019s need for reliable affordable and responsibly produced energy We anticipate that demand recovery for our products will continue and global supply constraints will persist in 2023 Our strategic pillars and financial priorities remain foundational supporting our resiliency through nearterm economic and geopolitical uncertainties We will continue to focus our attention on how we run the business always striving to be wellpositioned to create value for our stakeholders regardless of the market\u2019s tailwinds or turbulence Our goal is to position MPC as the refiner of choice generating the most cash through cycle and delivering superior returns to our shareholders with our steadfast commitment to returning capital Our achievements are a testament to the skills dedication and adaptability of our people who are enthusiastic about the opportunities ahead for our company Our workforce demonstrated tremendous effort in 2022 \u2013 to meet demand for our products to safely maintain and operate our assets and to support many valuecreating programs and strategies that are critical for our longterm success I am proud to lead MPC and I am thankful and grateful for

Core Values which guide us to hold steadfast in our commitment to safe and environmentally responsible operations to find and create shared value and to set and hold ourselves accountable to high expectations STRENGTHENING THE COMPETITIVE POSITION OF OUR ASSETS In September we completed the formation of our Martinez Renewables joint venture with Neste which enhances the value of the project to convert our idled Martinez California refinery into a renewable fuels facility The facility is expected to ramp up to produce 730 million gallons per year of renewable fuels by the end of 2023 with pretreatment capabilities expected to come online midyear 2023 At our Dickinson North Dakota renewable diesel facility we optimized operations to accommodate more advantaged feedstocks which lower the carbon intensity of the fuels we produce and further improve its economic potential In midstream segment adjusted EBITDA grew 7 year over year and the strength and stability of our logistics capabilities helped us navigate market fluctuations MPLX advanced several organic growth projects in the Permian Basin and remained a source of growing distributions for MPC and other unitholders In November MPLX raised its quarterly distribution by 10 At this current level MPC is expected to receive approximately 2 billion of annual distributions from MPLX CONTINUED CAPITAL AND COST DISCIPLINE Our success embedding a lowcost culture across the company enabled us to sustain our previously achieved 15 billion of structural cost reduction We remain focused on achieving operational excellence by reducing costs within our control improving efficiency driving operational improvements and being disciplined in capital allocation We also worked hard to mitigate higher energy input costs throughout the year and we believe our sustained structural cost reductions help us to more readily adapt to market fluctuations We continue to build upon our Focus on Energy FOE program which uses key performance indicators to guide energy management and promote energy efficiency across our refineries In 2022 FOErelated initiatives led to more than 50 million in energy cost savings for the year while avoiding 31700 metric tons of carbon dioxideequivalent emissions per month IMPROVING COMMERCIAL PERFORMANCE Over the past 18 months we have meaningfully changed our commercial approach across the company and strengthened our teams To unlock value we have empowered our people to optimize across our integrated system more effectively leverage our scale and proximity to key supply sources and demand hubs and improve product placement A nearterm focus has been securing advantaged renewable feedstocks as we continue to advance our renewable fuels production capabilities This includes exploring joint venture opportunities and strategic alliances within the renewable fuels value chain as well as looking to expand upon the partnerships we\u2019ve built with Neste and ADM In June our Green Bison Soy Processing joint venture with ADM began construction of North Dakota\u2019s first dedicated soybean processing plant By the seasonal harvest of 2023 it is expected to begin supplying approximately 600 million pounds a year of locally advantaged refined soybean oil exclusively to MPC helping us further optimize feedstock sourcing for renewable diesel production at our Dickinson facility We continued to progress our Galveston Bay STAR project which we expect to complete in the first quarter of 2023 The remaining scope of this strategic project is targeted to increase crude oil processing capacity by 40000 barrels per calendar day improve residual upgrading capacity by 17000 barrels per calendar day enhance diesel recovery and enable the facility to process more advantaged crude oil OUR PATH TO LEADING IN SUSTAINABLE ENERGY Across our integrated system we are meeting the energy needs of today while investing in an energydiverse future Our approach to sustainability which we apply across the components of ESG is key to our success in this effort We continue to focus on positioning MPC to lead in an energydiverse world by strengthening the resiliency of our business through reducing our carbon footprint and conserving natural resources innovating for the future by investing in renewables and emerging technologies and embedding sustainability in decisionmaking and in how we engage our stakeholders To help drive advancement we have set meaningful targets to reduce greenhouse gas GHG emissions methane emissions and freshwater intensity We believe our continued progress demonstrates a tangible FROM THE PRESIDENT AND CEO 2 MPC 2022 ANNUAL REPORT path to achieving these milestones In 2022 we established a goal to reduce our absolute Scope 3 category 11 GHG emissions to 15 below 2019 levels by 2030 becoming the first large downstream company to set an absolute Scope 3 target We also expanded our existing goal for reducing methane emissions intensity across our natural gas gathering and processing business creating a new longrange target of lowering intensity 75 from 2016 levels by 2030 Similarly to ensure we have the diversity of thought necessary to shape our future we continue to include a diversity equity and inclusion DEI component in the metrics that determine our annual bonus compensation Established in 2021 we were the first US independent refiner to link a DEI metric to executive and employee compensation We also remain focused on being a good neighbor in our communities through meaningful relationships with key stakeholders to understand needs and concerns define priorities and pursue shared goals In 2022 the company invested more than 20 million in the communities where we live and work as well as in the broader causes that united many of us and our employees contributed more than 4 million in additional support We continue to allocate significant growth capital to low carbon projects particularly around increasing our production of renewable fuels and natural gas In fact MPC is projected to become one of the largest global producers of renewable diesel in early 2024 and MPLX assets currently process about 10 of the natural gas in the United States MPC and MPLX are also actively involved in publicprivate alliances to explore and develop pathways for emerging opportunities around carbon capture utilization and sequestration CCUS as well as hydrogen energy production and utilization LOOKING FORWARD in 2023 I\u2019m more optimistic than ever about MPC\u2019s evolving role in meeting the world\u2019s need for reliable affordable and responsibly produced energy We anticipate that demand recovery for our products will continue and global supply constraints will persist in 2023 Our strategic pillars and financial priorities remain foundational supporting our resiliency through nearterm economic and geopolitical uncertainties We will continue to focus our attention on how we run the business always striving to be wellpositioned to create value for our stakeholders regardless of the market\u2019s tailwinds or turbulence Our goal is to position MPC as the refiner of choice generating the most cash through cycle and delivering superior returns to our shareholders with our steadfast commitment to returning capital Our achievements are a testament to the skills dedication and adaptability of our people who are enthusiastic about the opportunities ahead for our company Our workforce demonstrated tremendous effort in 2022 \u2013 to meet demand for our products

priorities and objectives\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Shareholders\r\n \r\nThroughout fiscal 2022 we continued to reduce friction for our customers and improve the interconnected experience Sales leveraging our digital platforms increased over 7 percent versus prior year and we continue to see record downloads traffic and sales via our mobile app This growth is attributable to several enhancements including an improved online experience for our Pro loyalty program the seamless connectivity we have provided for our military program and the launch of our new store mode feature which makes navigating the store and interacting with products much easier These enhancements translate to less friction for our customers as they navigate the digital world and connect to the physical world\r\n\r\nWe also drove productivity within the four walls of our store through multiple initiatives Our Get Stores Right or GSR space optimization initiative has optimized our selling square footage on a storebystore basis for hundreds of stores resulting in a better associate and customer experience\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nFiscal 2022 Another Year of Growth\r\nFiscal 2022 was another record year for The Home Depot We grew our sales by over 6 billion on top of the more than 40 billion of sales growth we delivered over the prior twoyear period Even more impressive is that we achieved these results while successfully navigating a number of challenges including persistent inflation ongoing global supply chain disruptions and a tight labor market\r\n\r\nDuring fiscal 2022 total sales grew 41 percent to\r\n1574 billion compared to fiscal 2021 Fiscal 2022 comparable sales growth was 31 percent for the total company and 29 percent in the US Our fiscal\r\n2022 net earnings were 171 billion and earnings per diluted share increased 75 percent to 1669\r\n\r\nThis performance was enabled by our associates and supplier partners as well as investments we have made in our people stores digital platforms supply chain technology and other strategic priorities\r\n\r\nWhile change is constant in our business our strategic priorities remain the same deliver the best customer experience in home improvement and extend our low\u00ad cost provider position Our objectives to grow market\r\n \r\nWe are pleased with the continued build out of our enhanced supply chain network reaching an important milestone in fiscal 2022 as we now have all our appliance delivery volume managed through our Market Delivery Operations Controlling the appliance delivery experience endtoend has helped to reduce complexity and drive meaningful improvements in customer satisfaction\r\n\r\n\r\nInvesting in Our People\r\nWhile all our investments have strengthened the business and positioned us to grow share and deliver exceptional value over the long term we believe that the most important investment we can make is in\r\nour people We know that our associates are our key differentiator and they are essential in helping us sustain an excellent customer experience As a result we recently announced that we will invest approximately\r\n1 billion in annualized compensation for our frontline hourly associates beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 We believe this investment will position us favorably in the market allowing us not only to attract\r\nthe most qualified talent but also retain the exceptional associate base that is already in place This is just one component of the associate investment story\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nTo provide the best customer experience in home improvement we must focus on cultivating the best associate experience in retail This means not only investing in competitive wages and benefits but also providing tools training and development\r\nopportunities that make working at The Home Depot an enjoyable and rewarding experience This year we took steps to better align our store leadership structure to deliver excellent customer service take care of our people and build strong relationships\r\nWe created new management positions focused entirely on the customer experience increasing the number of managers on the floor at any given time and freeing up time for other store leaders to devote to associate training and development The net result of these actions is an improved customer and associate experience while also creating new career paths and development opportunities for associates\r\n\r\nWe also remain focused on leveraging new tools and technology in stores to reduce complexity for associates and improve customer service In\r\nfiscal 2022 we upgraded our instore network and introduced the next generation of instore mobile devices known as hdPhones For the first time ever every associate on the floor will have an hdPhone in their hands with enhanced communication features tools and training capabilities With the deployment of empowering productivitydriving apps and other features these new hdPhones make it easier for associates to serve customers and helps them prioritize tasks more effectively\r\n\r\nIn addition to our associates the tenure and strength of our relationships with our supplier and\r\n \r\ntransportation partners have also been keys to our success Throughout the last few years our respective teams have worked tirelessly to flow product to distribution centers and stores as quickly and efficiently as possible And despite inflation and constrained global supply chain conditions our partners continue to work collaboratively with us to deliver on our promise\r\nto be the product authority in home improvement by investing to drive innovation and value for our customers\r\n\r\nI could not be more pleased with the resilience and strength that our associates have continued to\r\ndemonstrate and I want to thank them and our supplier partners for their hard work and dedication to serving our customers and communities\r\n\r\nAs we look to fiscal 2023 we anticipate continued macroeconomic uncertainty but believe we have the tools team and experience to effectively manage in any environment We will

Sales leveraging our digital platforms increased over 7 percent versus prior year and we continue to see record downloads traffic and sales via our mobile app This growth is attributable to several enhancements including an improved online experience for our Pro loyalty program the seamless connectivity we have provided for our military program and the launch of our new store mode feature which makes navigating the store and interacting with products much easier These enhancements translate to less friction for our customers as they navigate the digital world and connect to the physical world\r\n\r\nWe also drove productivity within the four walls of our store through multiple initiatives Our Get Stores Right or GSR space optimization initiative has optimized our selling square footage on a storebystore basis for hundreds of stores resulting in a better associate and customer experience\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nFiscal 2022 Another Year of Growth\r\nFiscal 2022 was another record year for The Home Depot We grew our sales by over 6 billion on top of the more than 40 billion of sales growth we delivered over the prior twoyear period Even more impressive is that we achieved these results while successfully navigating a number of challenges including persistent inflation ongoing global supply chain disruptions and a tight labor market\r\n\r\nDuring fiscal 2022 total sales grew 41 percent to\r\n1574 billion compared to fiscal 2021 Fiscal 2022 comparable sales growth was 31 percent for the total company and 29 percent in the US Our fiscal\r\n2022 net earnings were 171 billion and earnings per diluted share increased 75 percent to 1669\r\n\r\nThis performance was enabled by our associates and supplier partners as well as investments we have made in our people stores digital

improvement and extend our low\u00ad cost provider position Our objectives to grow market\r\n \r\nWe are pleased with the continued build out of our enhanced supply chain network reaching an important

complexity and drive meaningful improvements in customer satisfaction\r\n\r\n\r\nInvesting in Our People\r\nWhile all our investments have strengthened the business and positioned us to grow share and deliver exceptional value over the long term we believe that the most important investment we can make is in\r\nour people We know that our associates are our key differentiator and they are essential in helping us sustain an excellent customer experience As a result we recently announced that we will invest approximately\r\n1 billion in annualized compensation for our frontline hourly associates beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 We believe this investment will position us favorably in the market allowing us not only to attract\r\nthe most qualified talent but also retain the

providing tools training and development\r\nopportunities that make working at The Home Depot an enjoyable and rewarding experience This year we took steps to better align our store leadership structure to deliver excellent customer service take care of our people and build strong relationships\r\nWe created new management positions focused entirely on the customer experience increasing the number of managers on the floor at any given time and freeing up time for other store leaders to devote to associate training and development The net result of these actions is an improved customer and associate experience while also creating new career paths and development opportunities for associates\r\n\r\nWe also remain focused on leveraging new tools and technology in stores to reduce complexity for associates and improve customer service In\r\nfiscal 2022 we upgraded our instore network and introduced the next generation of instore mobile devices known as hdPhones For the first time ever every associate on the floor will have an hdPhone in their hands with enhanced communication features tools and training capabilities With the deployment of empowering productivitydriving apps and other features these new hdPhones make it easier for associates to serve customers and helps them prioritize tasks more effectively\r\n\r\nIn addition to our associates the tenure and strength of our relationships with our supplier and\r\n \r\ntransportation partners have also been keys to our success Throughout the last few years our respective teams have worked tirelessly to flow product to distribution centers and stores as quickly and efficiently as possible And despite inflation and constrained global supply chain conditions our partners continue to work collaboratively

tensions \u2014 particularly with China \u2014 to a politically divided America Almost all nations felt the effects of global economic uncertainty including higher energy and food prices mounting inflation rates and volatile markets and of course COVID19\u2019s lingering impacts While all these experiences and associated turmoil have serious ramifications on our company colleagues clients and the countries in which we do business their consequences on the world at large \u2014 with the extreme suffering of the Ukrainian people and the potential restructuring of the global order \u2014 are far more important As these events unfold America remains divided within its borders and its global leadership role is being challenged outside of its borders Nevertheless this is the moment when we should put aside our differences and work with other Western nations to come together in defense of democracy and essential Jamie Dimon Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 2 freedoms including free enterprise During other times of great crisis we have seen America in partnership with other countries around the globe unite for a common cause This is that moment again when our country needs to work across public and private sectors to lead while improving American competitiveness \u2014 which also means reestablishing the American promise of providing equal access to opportunity for all JPMorgan Chase a company that historically has worked across borders and boundaries will do its part to ensure the global economy is safe and secure In spite of the unsettling landscape 2022 was somewhat surprisingly another strong year for JPMorgan Chase with the firm generating record revenue for the fifth year in a row as well as setting numerous records in each of our lines of business We earned revenue in 2022 of 1323 billion1 and net income of 377 billion with return on tangible common equity ROTCE of 18 reflecting strong underlying performance across our businesses We also maintained our quarterly common dividend of 100 per share and continued to reinforce our fortress balance sheet We grew market share in several of our businesses and continued to make significant investments in products people and technology while exercising strict credit discipline In total we extended credit and raised capital of 24 trillion for our consumer and institutional clients around the world I remain proud of our company\u2019s resiliency and of what our hundreds of thousands of employees around the world have achieved collectively and individually Throughout these challenging past few years we never stopped doing all the things we should be doing to serve our clients and our communities Adhering to our basic principles and strategies see sidebar on Steadfast Principles on page 5 allows us to drive good organic growth and properly manage our capital including dividends and stock buybacks as we have 1 Represents managed revenue 3 consistently demonstrated for decades Our performance results are shown in the charts on pages 612 which illustrate how we have grown our franchises how we compare with our competitors and how we look at our fortress balance sheet I invite you to peruse them at your leisure In addition I urge you to read the CEO letters in this Annual Report which will give you more specific details about our businesses and our plans for the future As you know we are champions of banking\u2019s essential role in a community \u2014 its potential for bringing people together for enabling companies and individuals to attain their goals and for being a source of strength in difficult times As I often remind our employees the work we do matters and has impact We help people and institutions finance and achieve their aspirations lifting up individuals homeowners small businesses larger corporations schools hospitals cities and countries in all regions of the world 4 STEADFAST PRINCIPLES WORTH REPEATING Looking back on the past two decades \u2014 starting from my time as CEO of Bank One in 2000 \u2014 there is one common theme our unwavering dedication to help clients communities and countries throughout the world It is clear that our financial discipline constant investment in innovation and ongoing development of our people are what enabled us to achieve this consistency and commitment In addition across the firm we uphold certain steadfast tenets that are worth repeating First our work has very real human impact While JPMorgan Chase stock is owned by large institutions pension plans mutual funds and directly by single investors in almost all cases the ultimate beneficiaries are individuals in our communities More than 100 million people in the United States own stock many in one way or another own JPMorgan Chase stock Frequently these shareholders are veterans teachers police officers firefighters healthcare workers retirees or those saving for a home education or retirement Often our employees also bank these shareholders as well as their families and their companies Your management team goes to work every day recognizing the enormous responsibility that we have to all of our shareholders Second shareholder value can be built only if you maintain a healthy and vibrant company which means doing a good job of taking care of your customers employees and communities Conversely how can you have a healthy company if you neglect any of these stakeholders As we have learned over the past few years there are myriad ways an institution can demonstrate its compassion for its employees and its communities while still upholding shareholder value this letter We recognize our strengths and vulnerabilities and we play our hand as best we can Sixth we operate with a very important silent partner \u2014 the US government \u2014 noting as my friend Warren Buffett points out that his company\u2019s success is predicated upon the extraordinary conditions our country creates He is right to say to his shareholders that when they see the American flag they all should say thank you We should too JPMorgan Chase is a healthy and thriving company and we always want to give back and pay our fair share We do pay our fair share \u2014 and we want it to be spent well and have the greatest impact To give you an idea of where our taxes and fees go In the last 10 years we paid more than 43 billion in federal state and local taxes in the United States and almost 19 billion in taxes outside of the United States We also paid the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation over 10 billion so that it has the resources to cover failure in the American banking sector Our partner \u2014 the federal government \u2014 also imposes significant regulations upon us and it is imperative that we meet all legal and regulatory requirements imposed on our company Seventh and finally we know the foundation of our success rests with our people They are the frontline both individually and as teams serving our customers and communities building the technology making the strategic decisions managing the risks determining our investments and driving innovation However you view the world \u2014 its complexity risks and opportunities \u2014 a company\u2019s prosperity requires a great team of people with guts brains integrity enormous capabilities and high standards of professional excellence to ensure its ongoing success Third while we don\u2019t run the company worrying about the stock price in the short run in the long run we consider our stock price a measure of our progress over time This progress is a function of continual investments in our people systems and products in good and bad times to build our capabilities These important investments will also drive our company\u2019s future prospects and position it to grow and prosper for decades Measured by stock performance our progress is exceptional For example whether looking back 10 years or even farther to 2004 when the JPMorgan ChaseBank One merger took place we have significantly outperformed the Standard  Poor\u2019s 500 Index and the Standard  Poor\u2019s Financials Index Fourth we are united behind basic principles and strategies you can see the How We Do Business principles on our website that have helped build this company and made it thrive \u2014 from maintaining a fortress balance sheet constantly investing and nurturing talent to fully satisfying regulators continually improving risk governance and controls and serving customers and clients while lifting up communities worldwide This philosophy is embedded in our company culture and influences nearly every role in the firm Fifth we strive to build enduring businesses which rely on and benefit from one another but we are not a conglomerate This structure helps generate our superior returns Nonetheless despite our best efforts the walls that protect this company are not particularly high \u2014 and we face extraordinary competition I have written about this reality extensively in the past and cover it again

tensions \u2014 particularly with China \u2014 to a politically divided America Almost all nations felt the effects of global economic uncertainty including higher energy and food prices mounting inflation rates and volatile markets and of course COVID19\u2019s lingering impacts While all these experiences and associated turmoil have serious ramifications on our company colleagues clients and the countries in which we do business their consequences on the world at large \u2014 with the extreme suffering of the Ukrainian people and the potential restructuring of the global order \u2014 are far more important As these events unfold America remains divided within its borders and its global leadership role is being challenged outside of its borders Nevertheless this is the moment when we should put aside our differences and work with other Western nations to come together in defense of democracy and essential Jamie Dimon Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 2 freedoms including free enterprise During other times of great crisis we have seen America in partnership with other countries around the globe unite for a common cause This is that moment again when our country needs to work across public and private sectors to lead while improving American competitiveness \u2014 which also means reestablishing the American promise of providing equal access to opportunity for all JPMorgan Chase a company that historically has worked across borders and boundaries will do its part to ensure the global economy is safe and secure In spite of the unsettling landscape 2022 was somewhat surprisingly another strong year for JPMorgan Chase with the firm generating record revenue for the fifth year in a row as well as setting numerous records in each of our lines of business We earned revenue in 2022 of 1323 billion1 and net income of 377 billion with return on tangible common equity ROTCE of 18 reflecting strong underlying performance across our businesses We also maintained our quarterly common dividend of 100 per share and continued to reinforce our fortress balance sheet We grew market share in several of our businesses and continued to make significant investments in products people and technology while exercising strict credit discipline In total we extended credit and raised capital of 24 trillion for our consumer and institutional clients around the world I remain proud of our company\u2019s resiliency and of what our hundreds of thousands of employees around the world have achieved collectively and individually Throughout these challenging past few years we never stopped doing all the things we should be doing to serve our clients and our communities Adhering to our basic principles and strategies see sidebar on Steadfast Principles on page 5 allows us to drive good organic growth and properly manage our capital including dividends and stock buybacks as we have 1 Represents managed revenue 3 consistently demonstrated for decades Our performance results are shown in the charts on pages 612 which illustrate how we have grown our franchises how we compare with our competitors and how we look at our fortress balance sheet I invite you to peruse them at your leisure In addition I urge you to read the CEO letters in this Annual Report which will give you more specific details about our businesses and our plans for the future As you know we are champions of banking\u2019s essential role in a community \u2014 its potential for bringing people together for enabling companies and individuals to attain their goals and for being a source of strength in difficult times As I often remind our employees the work we do matters and has impact We help people and institutions finance and achieve their aspirations lifting up individuals homeowners small businesses larger corporations schools hospitals cities and countries in all regions of the world 4 STEADFAST PRINCIPLES WORTH REPEATING Looking back on the past two decades \u2014 starting from my time as CEO of Bank One in 2000 \u2014 there is one common theme our unwavering dedication to help clients communities and countries throughout the world It is clear that our financial discipline constant investment in innovation and ongoing development of our people are what enabled us to achieve this consistency and commitment In addition across the firm we uphold certain steadfast tenets that are worth repeating First our work has very real human impact While JPMorgan Chase stock is owned by large institutions pension plans mutual funds and directly by single investors in almost all cases the ultimate beneficiaries are individuals in our communities More than 100 million people in the United States own stock many in one way or another own JPMorgan Chase stock Frequently these shareholders are veterans teachers police officers firefighters healthcare workers retirees or those saving for a home education or retirement Often our employees also bank these shareholders as well as their families and their companies Your management team goes to work every day recognizing the enormous responsibility that we have to all of our shareholders Second shareholder value can be built only if you maintain a healthy and vibrant company which means doing a good job of taking care of your customers employees and communities Conversely how can you have a healthy company if you neglect any of these stakeholders As we have learned over the past few years there are myriad ways an institution can demonstrate its compassion for its employees and its communities while still upholding shareholder value this letter We recognize our strengths and vulnerabilities and we play our hand as best we can Sixth we operate with a very important silent partner \u2014 the US government \u2014 noting as my friend Warren Buffett points out that his company\u2019s success is predicated upon the extraordinary conditions our country creates He is right to say to his shareholders that when they see the American flag they all should say thank you We should too JPMorgan Chase is a healthy and thriving company and we always want to give back and pay our fair share We do pay our fair share \u2014 and we want it to be spent well and have the greatest impact To give you an idea of where our taxes and fees go In the last 10 years we paid more than 43 billion in federal state and local taxes in the United States and almost 19 billion in taxes outside of the United States We also paid the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation over 10 billion so that it has the resources to cover failure in the American banking sector Our partner \u2014 the federal government \u2014 also imposes significant regulations upon us and it is imperative that we meet all legal and regulatory requirements imposed on our company Seventh and finally we know the foundation of our success rests with our people They are the frontline both individually and as teams serving our customers and communities building the technology making the strategic decisions managing the risks determining our investments and driving innovation However you view the world \u2014 its complexity risks and opportunities \u2014 a company\u2019s prosperity requires a great team of people with guts brains integrity enormous capabilities and high standards of professional excellence to ensure its ongoing success Third while we don\u2019t run the company worrying about the stock price in the short run in the long run we consider our stock price a measure of our progress over time This progress is a function of continual investments in our people systems and products in good and bad times to build our capabilities These important investments will also drive our company\u2019s future prospects and position it to grow and prosper for decades Measured by stock performance our progress is exceptional For example whether looking back 10 years or even farther to 2004 when the JPMorgan ChaseBank One merger took place we have significantly outperformed the Standard  Poor\u2019s 500 Index and the Standard  Poor\u2019s Financials Index Fourth we are united behind basic principles and strategies you can see the How We Do Business principles on our website that have helped build this company and made it thrive \u2014 from maintaining a fortress balance sheet constantly investing and nurturing talent to fully satisfying regulators continually improving risk governance and controls and serving customers and clients while lifting up communities worldwide This philosophy is embedded in our company culture and influences nearly every role in the firm Fifth we strive to build enduring businesses which rely on and benefit from one another but we are not a conglomerate This structure helps generate our superior returns Nonetheless despite our best efforts the walls that protect this company are not particularly high \u2014 and we face extraordinary competition I have written about

accommodating those shifts with agility earn us the privilege of continuing to serve our customers This is what makes our industry so exciting The ways customers shop for food is ever evolving and always changing Customers used to shop once a week checking off items from handwritten lists Today our customers manage their groceries with a mix of inperson and online shopping rely on digital technologies to make lists and track spending and shop for more readymade meal solutions Outside our stores we know customers spend approximately half of their food budgets at restaurants What hasn\u2019t changed is our passion to deliver fresh affordable food to the communities we serve and inspire our customers to discover their love for food Our business model is built around offering fresh products at competitive prices with no compromise on quality selection and convenience This is a timetested approach in any operating environment and we remain committed to it into the future Every day we provide our customers with lower prices on the foods they love and more choices to meet their needs and wants Our passion for our customers associates and communities is also on display in our willingness to take on difficult challenges and see them through We see it in the way our store and supply chain teams respond to natural disasters always the first to help our communities We see it in the way our associates worked with the White House governors and mayors to ensure America had access to fresh affordable food during the pandemic And we see it in our willingness to address one of our food systems most intractable challenges \u2013 that more than 40 of the food produced goes to waste each year while one in eight Americans struggle with hunger \u2013 through our Zero Hunger  Zero Waste impact plan Kroger has the fortitude to take on these challenges because we know that when we take care of our customers associates and communities our shareholders will benefit We continue delivering value for our shareholders On a threeyear basis Kroger\u2019s adjusted net earnings per diluted share has grown at a compounded annual growth rate of 245 which has helped support a total shareholder return of 782 over the same period This incredible outcome is the result of our dedicated and thriving associates delivering a full fresh and friendly experience for more than 11 million customers every day It\u2019s no wonder Kroger was recently included in a list of America\u2019s Most Trustworthy Companies From our manufacturing facilities and fulfillment centers to our store and office teams we appreciate everything our associates do to embody Our Purpose To Feed the Human Spirit Our associates are driving consistent execution of our gotomarket strategy in every interaction everyday positioning the company for sustainable longterm growth Kroger is building momentum and has the people the plan and the operational discipline to win today and in the future    Update on proposed merger with Albertsons Co In October 2022 we announced our definitive merger agreement with Albertsons Companies Inc We are incredibly impressed with the Albertsons team and their commitment to their associates culture customers and communities Lower prices More Choices We believe bringing our highly complementary organizations together will provide customers with lower prices and more choices Our proposed merger will mean more value for our customers with lower prices and more food choices to discover And we will begin on day one postclose with 500 million already committed to bringing down prices Empower our associates\u2019 success Our associates are responsible for our success and we are committed to investing in theirs The proposed combination will secure the longterm future of union jobs while creating a more competitive alternative to larger nonunion retailers We have already committed 1 billion to continue raising associate wages and comprehensive industryleading benefits It is vital that we support our associates as they explore what their individual career paths will be So many of our associates come to Kroger to experience their first job In 2022 approximately 20 of our new hires were 18 years old or younger It is amazing that Kroger introduces so many young people to a fulfilling career in the grocery industry We demonstrate how our associates can choose from many different paths and how a foundation in amazing customer service supports associates\u2019 longterm goals no matter where associates choose to build their careers At Kroger associates get to help families discover healthier answers to the question \u201cwhat\u2019s for dinner tonight\u201d create technology that makes customers\u2019 shopping trips simpler make healthcare more accessible for their neighbors \u2013 and even dream up a job that has yet to be created The career opportunities are truly endless Build healthier communities free of hunger The proposed merger will also allow our organization to invest in our communities in ways we simply cannot do on our own I am so proud of what we have accomplished in our Zero Hunger  Zero Waste work and am impressed by the Albertsons team\u2019s commitment to supporting their communities as outlined in their Recipe for Change plan We know that when families eat together it supports their children\u2019s success across all aspects of their lives I cannot wait to see how our combined efforts will connect people with the meals they need to thrive We look forward to continue working cooperatively with regulators and remain on track for a projected closure of the merger in early 2024 2022 in Review As the pandemic continued to fade and inflation caused ongoing economic uncertainty our associates showed up for our customers Last year Kroger associates did everything we could to minimize the impact of inflation and help stretch tight food budgets so families could access fresh affordable food with zero compromise on convenience or selection Our Leading with Fresh and Accelerating with Digital strategy and key focus areas of Fresh Our Brands seamless and personalization give us the flexibility to navigate a changing operating environment \u2013 all while providing value to our customers and our associates We will continue to consider a five to tenyear time horizon as we make key decisions During the year we \uf0b7 Achieved positive identical sales without fuel of 56 \uf0b7 Increased associate wages resulting in an average hourly wage of 18 and rate of more than 23 with comprehensive benefits \uf0b7 Exceeded 1 billion in cost savings for the fifth consecutive year \uf0b7 Announced 14 additional Kroger Delivery locations across the US The subsequent sections will highlight progress we made across our business in 2022 and ways we intend to continue building on our momentum moving forward Leading with Fresh For us Fresh for EveryoneTM is more than a brand promise It\u2019s a commitment to bringing fresh affordable foods to more people in more neighborhoods Fresh foods are central to families living healthy thriving lives And our customers prioritize fresh when they shop with Kroger \u2013 with more than more than 90 of customers purchasing fresh foods Many companies claim they are focused on fresh \u2013 we have demonstrated success in creating fresher shopping experiences and our customers are rewarding us for it In the last year we continued to put our focus on fresh both with our instore and ecommerce experiences The EndtoEnd Fresh initiative is at the center of how we are changing the way we bring fresh to life in our stores Today we have more than 1400 stores implementing this initiative in their produce departments driving higher produce and overall store sales We look forward to exploring how we can expand this work in other fresh departments in 2023 and beyond We are also working closely with our technology and supply chain teams to understand ways we can add days of freshness to our products From optimizing delivery routes to simplifying associate tasks we want to ensure our customers can buy food at its peak of freshness and trust those items will remain fresh in their homes Freshness is also important when we think about innovation in Our Brands In 2022 we launched a simplified openingpricepoint brand known as Smart Way\u2122 This new concept is easily identifiable for customers who want to stretch their budgets It joins Kroger\u2019s carefully curated extensive Our Brands portfolio which includes the company\u2019s namesake Kroger brand Simple Truth\u00ae Private Selection\u00ae Home Chef\u00ae and Heritage Farm\u00ae among others In addition to the Smart Way brand introduction we launched more than 680 new unique Our Brands products last year We engage with food trends throughout the year to understand what our customers are craving and ensure we have those items on our shelves We aim to bring every customer the highquality affordable products they love \u2013 from pantry staples and fresh foods to readytoheat restaurantquality meals Accelerating with Digital We continue to invest in our seamless ecosystem \u2013 bringing our customers the products they love when and where they want them We see customers shift the ways they interact with us based on their individual needs which aligns with our vision of a truly seamless shopping experience Our goal remains to be there for our customers \u2013 however they need us in a particular moment When it fits their day\u2019s plans customers may choose to shop in our stores Sometimes they find a Kroger Delivery order easier during a busy weekend Or when nothing looks good in the refrigerator or the last paper towel comes off the roll we\u2019re here with Kroger Delivery Now delivering in as little as 30 minutes We remain wellpositioned to achieve doubledigit digital growth in the next three years Our brickandmortar stores and automated fulfillment centers work together to ensure our customers have access to the fresh foods and pantry staples they want when they need them most Our efforts to bring a truly personalized shopping experience to life are creating value for our customers We serve the right promotions at the right time directly to the customers who would be most interested in the offer From providing suggestions to start a basket to offering a new item we are providing customers real value In 2022 alone customers saved 14 billion through a combination of paper and digital coupons Last year we also launched Boost by Kroger the retail industry\u2019s mostaffordable membership program We are already exceeding internal expectations in both incremental engagement and household spend We look forward to evolving our membership program to appeal to more customers and create additional value The Accelerating with Digital piece of our strategy continues to drive our profit flywheel We are improving margins by reducing digital costtoserve all while growing our alternative profit streams Investing in Our Associates Our associates are at the heart of everything we do I am always impressed at the ways they create memorable food moments for our customers every day I regularly think back to my time working in a Kroger store when I began my career more than 40 years ago I learned how to run a successful store how to create real community with my customers and coworkers and how important our stores are to the neighborhoods they serve Kroger provides opportunities for people seeking their first job a new beginning or a new challenge to discover a fulfilling career path And we continue to invest in our associates Earlier this year we committed nearly 800 million to raise wages and benefits create new training opportunities and improve healthcare options in 2023 This investment builds on our 19 billion in incremental investments in wages and comprehensive benefits Kroger has made since 2018 As a result we raised our average hourly rate to 18 or 2350 an hour with comprehensive benefits We understand we must support our associates\u2019 holistic wellbeing To accomplish this goal Kroger creates programs that power our associates\u2019 growth including a worldclass educational benefit program offering associates up to 21000 toward continuing education opportunities \u2013 whatever that may mean to our associates In 2022 alone more than 5000 people engaged with this program We provide affordable accessible healthcare options which includes free counseling Also in 2022 we introduced a firstofitskind free financial coaching services to all our hourly associates We remain committed to helping our associates thrive in their careers and at home ensuring Kroger remains an employer of choice Environmental Sustainability and Social Impact Kroger is committed to responsible sourcing practices respecting human rights and advancing animal welfare Our comprehensive programs hold our suppliers accountable to meet our high standards and support our continual improvement We rely on deep knowledge from our category sourcing leaders data insights and input from our investors industry groups NGOs and subjectmatter experts In 2022 we published our greenhouse gas GHG reduction goal roadmap We are diligently working to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from our operations by 30 by 2030 against a 2018 baseline This goal was developed using climate science supporting a wellbelow 2\u00baC climate scenario according to the absolute contraction method Kroger made considerable progress against our Framework for Action Diversity Equity  Inclusion plan Launched in 2020 this action plan is accelerating change across the entire company Since its introduction we successfully provided unconscious bias training to all leaders and nearly half a million associates We are working with 53 Historically Black Colleges and Universities and institutions serving Hispanic Asian American and Pacific Islander and Native American students And we are taking strong steps to achieve our goal of increasing our spend with diverse suppliers to 10 billion annually by 2030 We are growing the many ways we participate in our communities \u2013 both big and small In 2022 we celebrated the fifth anniversary of our Zero Hunger  Zero Waste impact plan Since

Hunger  Zero Waste impact plan Kroger has the fortitude to take on these challenges because we know that when we take care of our customers associates and communities our shareholders will benefit We continue delivering value for our shareholders On a threeyear basis Kroger\u2019s adjusted net earnings per diluted share has grown at a compounded annual growth rate of 245 which has helped support a total shareholder return of 782 over the same period This incredible outcome is the result of our dedicated and thriving associates delivering a full fresh and friendly experience for more than 11 million customers every day It\u2019s no wonder Kroger was recently included in a list of America\u2019s Most Trustworthy Companies From our manufacturing facilities and fulfillment centers to our

the longterm future of union jobs while creating a more competitive alternative to larger nonunion retailers We have already committed 1 billion to continue raising associate wages and comprehensive

associates can choose from many different paths and how a foundation in amazing customer service supports associates\u2019 longterm goals no matter where associates choose to build their careers At

initiative is at the center of how we are changing the way we bring fresh to life in our stores Today we have more than 1400 stores implementing this initiative in their produce departments driving higher produce and overall store sales We look forward to exploring how we can expand this work in other fresh departments in 2023 and beyond We are also working closely with our technology and supply chain teams to understand ways we can add days of freshness to our products From optimizing delivery routes to simplifying associate tasks we want to ensure our customers can buy food at its peak of freshness and trust those items will remain fresh in their homes Freshness is also important when we think about innovation in Our Brands In 2022 we launched a simplified openingpricepoint brand known

successful store how to create real community with my customers and coworkers and how important our stores are to the neighborhoods they serve Kroger provides opportunities for people seeking their first job a new beginning or a new challenge to discover a fulfilling career path And we continue to invest in our associates Earlier this year we committed nearly 800 million to raise wages and

of major change for ATT and we are proud to have ended the year in a stronger position The realities of our industry changing consumer expectations and an evolving macroeconomic environment dictated

WarnerMedia We have confidence there is a bright future for an ATT that delivers the best in connectivity Connectivity is ingrained in our legacy going back nearly 150 years We have the assets talent and experience to connect people to greater possibility with simplicity expertise and inspiration In 2022 we worked to fulfill this purpose in 3 ways 1 We grew customer relationships at a near recordsetting pace taking full advantage of alltimehigh levels of demand for strong reliable connectivity 2 We were effective and efficient in our operations reaching more than 5 billion of our 3year 6 billionplus runrate cost transformation target 3 Our deliberate capital allocation strategy enabled us to invest in 5G and fiber at historic levels reduce our net debt by about 24 billion and set up a structure we believe will drive better returns for you our shareholders1 This includes continuing to provide an attractive dividend Consistency in operational excellence Describing our gotomarket strategy is as simple as the strategy itself Be consistent with our offers to our customers and make it easy for them to do business with us Wireless In US wireless we attracted nearly 29 million postpaid phone net additions in 2022 marking our secondbest annual results in more than a decade behind only 2021 We also grew wireless service revenues by more than 5 year over year representing a multiyear high And we did this while continuing to concentrate on profitability increasing wireless EBITDA by nearly 4 and achieving our most profitable year on record 2 We are also a leader in the Internet of Things IoT We added more than 12 million connected devices in 2022 becoming the first US carrier to exceed 100 million connected devices John Stankey Chief Executive Officer 2 ATT Inc 2022 Annual Report Our wireless momentum was a direct result of our simplified value proposition lower acquisition costs distribution efficiencies and our ability to meet customers on their terms The strength of our wireless network played a large role in our success with our recent spectrum investments performing even better than expected In fact we were efficient enough with our deployment of midband 5G spectrum that we reached more than 150 million people more than double our original yearend coverage target And we expect to hit 200 million people by the end of 2023 As a result our already consistent download speeds increased materially as recently recognized in the Root Metrics secondhalf 2022 results This increased speed provided another significant benefit to our customers

million We led the industry in bringing fiber to homes5 and closed the year with the ability to serve more than 19 million consumer locations We also have the ability to serve more than 3 million

and experience to connect people to greater possibility with simplicity expertise and inspiration In 2022 we worked to fulfill this purpose in 3 ways 1 We grew customer relationships at a near recordsetting pace taking full advantage of alltimehigh levels of demand for strong reliable connectivity 2 We were effective and efficient in our operations reaching more than 5 billion of our 3year 6 billionplus runrate cost transformation target 3 Our deliberate capital allocation strategy enabled us to invest in 5G and fiber at historic levels reduce our net debt by about 24 billion and set up a structure we believe will drive better returns for you our shareholders1 This includes continuing to provide an attractive dividend Consistency in operational excellence Describing our gotomarket strategy is as simple as the strategy itself Be consistent with our offers to our customers and make it easy for them to do business with us Wireless In US wireless we attracted nearly 29 million postpaid phone net additions in 2022 marking our secondbest annual results in more than a decade behind only 2021 We also grew wireless service revenues by more than 5 year over year representing a multiyear high And we did this while continuing to concentrate on profitability increasing wireless EBITDA by nearly 4 and achieving our most profitable year on record 2 We are also a leader in the Internet of Things IoT We added more than 12 million connected devices in 2022 becoming the first US carrier to exceed 100 million connected devices John Stankey Chief Executive Officer 2 ATT Inc 2022 Annual Report Our wireless momentum was a direct result of our simplified value proposition lower acquisition costs distribution efficiencies and our ability to meet customers on their terms The strength of our wireless network played a large role in our success with our recent spectrum investments performing even better than expected In fact we were efficient enough with our deployment of midband 5G spectrum that we reached more than 150 million people more than double our original yearend coverage target And we expect to hit 200 million people by the end of 2023 As a result our already consistent download speeds increased materially as recently recognized in the Root Metrics secondhalf 2022 results This increased speed provided another significant benefit to our customers

connects people and businesses with each other and to the world Fiber investments have a multidecade lifespan and we\u2019re investing heavily to build out our network We believe that ATT offers the best wired internet available Quite simply where we build fiber we win 2022 marked our fifth straight year with 1 million or more net additions raising our ATT Fiber subscriber base to more than 7 million We led the industry in bringing fiber to homes5 and closed the year with the ability to serve more than 19 million consumer locations We also have the ability to serve more than 3 million business locations We are on track to reach our previously announced goal of 30 millionplus total locations including consumer and business by the end of 2025 Our recently announced agreement to form a joint venture with BlackRock Alternatives \u2014 Gigapower \u2014 is an innovative new business model we are testing to dramatically increase the pace of fiber installation outside of our traditional wireline markets We believe agile ventures like this open up new possibilities to connect underserved markets with fiber and can compete more effectively for the chance to coinvest with the US government on our shared objectives of a better connected America ATT has the ability to serve more than 22 million consumer and business locations with fiber 3 These results illustrate our approach has delivered and while we\u2019ll remain agile as the industry and economy shift we\u2019re confident in our ability to continue executing at a high level Corporate responsibility This drive to connect people to greater possibility includes doing our part to create a more connected society and provide underserved communities with the resources they need for education employment health care and economic opportunity Despite the growing availability of highquality connectivity onefifth of the US population is still impacted by the digital divide 6 We\u2019re passionate about addressing this issue because our country has a onceinageneration opportunity to close the broadband gap Achieving this will give more Americans better opportunities to further their education and access online training to develop workforce skills all of which helps foster greater economic equity That\u2019s why we made a 3year 2 billion commitment in 2021 to help bridge the digital divide With this commitment and ATT\u2019s technology platforms for 5G and fiber deployment that are affordable sustainable and durable we have the expertise and scale to make a longterm difference We\u2019re working to address 3 key components to the digital divide 1 Access This primarily impacts areas of the country where deployment can be difficult or slow but it\u2019s starting to pick up thanks to the more than 48 billion allocated by Congress and the Biden administration to expand broadband infrastructure Decisions on where to invest in that infrastructure have largely been vested in states tribal governments and municipalities and we\u2019re working diligently to find the right opportunities for publicprivate partnerships that enable ATT to help fund build and maintain these networks 2

sustainability into everything we do whether designing products commuting selecting construction materials or working with suppliers to set their own net zero targets For example through our Net Zero program we work closely with suppliers to determine their Scope 1 2 and 3 emissions set reduction targets and promote strategic action We know that reaching net zero emissions across our value chain will not be an easy task Right now our Scope 3 emissions are increasing and will continue to do so as we work to support the global demand for the services we provide We see our role as protecting people and the planet through responsible operations \u2014 minimizing our emissions and the energy and water used to power our data centers that enable users to access our products and the workplaces where those products are built and managed \u2014 while protecting workers and the environment in our supply chain Within our global footprint our data centers generate the highest percentage of our energy use water use and GHG emissions which is why increasing their efficiency is critical in maintaining net zero operations and striving for a net zero value chain Our approach to data center sustainability focuses on using less \u2014 less energy water unnecessary infrastructure and waste \u2014 and building the most efficient buildings we can We further reduce our environmental impact through renewable energy water stewardship circularity and lowcarbon alternatives Operating sustainable data centers is foundational to our sustainability strategy Our strategy is anchored by three

to supply chains historic inflationary pressures persistent lockdowns in China and the largest war on European soil since World War II combined to create a tumultuous environment for businesses and financial markets As a leading global bank with a morethan210year history these dynamics are not unfamiliar to us And as we showed throughout the pandemic Citi is an important source of strength and stability during times of immense change and challenge This is an opportunity and a responsibility we take very seriously So for me 2022 will be remembered most for two things The first is how we continued to support our clients We helped them navigate macro and geopolitical dynamics We advised them in their digital transformations and supported the shifts in their business models We guided them in their transitions toward a cleanenergy economy When war broke out in Ukraine we sprang to the aid of our employees and clients on the ground and helped our multinational clients unwind their operations in Russia in response to Western sanctions aimed at the country The second is the important strides we are making to position Citi to win in the decade ahead In March 2022 at our first Investor Day in several years we set a vision and refreshed our strategy to change our business mix and simplify our operating model We have absolute clarity on our future and we are focused on accelerating growth gaining share and increasing returns for shareholders over time By most measures we ended the year in a stronger position than we started A foundation for the future Our vision for Citi is to be the preeminent banking partner for institutions with crossborder needs a global leader in wealth management and a valued personal bank in our home market To that end we have laid the foundation by focusing on five core interconnected businesses Services Markets Banking Global Wealth Management and US Personal Banking We intentionally designed our business mix to withstand different macroeconomic conditions and we have seen that borne out over the past year So whilst the environment has changed our strategy has not and we remain steadfast in executing and delivering for our shareholders For the year we delivered 148 billion in net income on revenues of 753 billion Our Return on Tangible Common Equity RoTCE1  was 89 and we remain on track to achieve an RoTCE of 11\u201312 in the medium term We increased our Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio by nearly 80 basis points to 13 which includes a buffer of 100 basis points above the regulatory requirement to help absorb the impact of various macro and other factors Finally our tangible book value per share1 increased to 8165 and we returned more than 7 billion to our shareholders through common dividends and share repurchases How our core businesses fared Our Services business had an exceptional year with revenues up 27 versus 2021 Treasury and Trade Solutions TTS the crown jewel of our global network experienced a 32 increase in revenues as we continued to grow our wallet share with existing clients whilst also adding new client relationships With the introduction of a sevenday sweeps service the industry\u2019s first 247 USD clearing capabilities and instant payments in 33 markets we\u2019re moving closer to an alwayson near realtime cash management solution for corporate clients In Securities Services we grew yearly revenues by 15 and onboarded 12 trillion in assets under custody and administration Our Markets business closed 2022 with revenues up 7 from 2021 ending the year with one of the best fourth quarters in recent memory Our traders navigated the volatility quite well with notable performance amongst corporate clients and strong gains in FX and rates And together with our Corporate Bank our Markets team continued to optimize its balance sheet Revenues in Banking fell 35 as we contended with a materially slower deal environment But Banking remains a key part of our strategy and we continued to play a leading role in the year\u2019s notable transactions This included acting as one of the lead advisors on Volkswagen\u2019s \u20ac94 billion IPO of Porsche the largest public listing of the year and serving as financial advisor to Amgen on its proposed 278 billion acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics We hired exceptional bankers in healthcare clean energy and technology \u2014 all sectors critical to our growth \u2014 and welcomed new talent into our Commercial Bank as it has expanded into Canada Germany and Switzerland In US Personal Banking revenues for the year rose 7 as we bolstered our leadership in payments and lending Branded Cards grew revenues by 9 whilst Retail Services revenues were up 7 We launched new credit cards with ExxonMobil and ATT and celebrated 35 years of our cobranded credit \u201cWe have absolute clarity on our future and we are focused on accelerating growth gaining share and increasing returns for shareholders over time\u201d Letter to shareholders 2 3 Celebrated 35 years of the American Airlines cobranded credit card a leading airline rewards credit card Hired exceptional talent in Banking Capital Markets and Advisory to strengthen coverage of growth sectors such as healthcare clean energy and technology Expanded the Private Bank to France and Germany opened the first Citi Global Wealth Center in Hong Kong and established a Citi Global Wealth at Work presence in Luxembourg Grew Citi Commercial Bank by expanding into Canada Germany and Switzerland and hiring talent to execute on our clientcentric coverage model Served as one of the lead advisors on Porsche\u2019s IPO and as financial advisor on Amgen\u2019s proposed acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics Onboarded 12 trillion of new assets under custody and administration in Securities Services Enhanced risk and controls by improving stress test capabilities and our approval process for new products Debuted a refreshed strategy for improving returns at Citi\u2019s Investor Day Built out digital capabilities in our marketleading Treasury and Trade Solutions business and launched a 247 payments clearing service Simplified our operating model by closing the sale of five consumer businesses and announced plans to end nearly all operations in Russia Strengthened connections between businesses resulting in more than 60000 client referrals from the US Personal Bank to Citi Global Wealth Implemented new performance management framework to drive excellence and accountability across the firm A year of progress 4 5 1 RoTCE and tangible book value per share are nonGAAP financial measures For more information see page 40 of Citi\u2019s 2022 Form 10K 2 Citi\u2019s binding CET1 Capital ratio was derived under the Basel III Standardized Approach as of December 31 2022 3 Closed the sale of India and Vietnam consumer businesses in March 2023 card partnership with American Airlines Revenues in Retail Banking were roughly flat for the full year but we continued to enhance our digital capabilities growing digital users by 6 for the year And as part of our efforts to break down barriers to banking last year we became the first of the largest US banks to completely eliminate overdraft fees and returned item fees for our customers We also made progress building out our Global Wealth Management business despite the economic headwinds that slowed activity amongst our Asiabased clients in particular and reduced overall revenues by 2 Having unified our Wealth businesses under a single platform we\u2019ve been acquiring new clients and investing in hiring advisors to make sure we\u2019re wellpositioned for success as the markets recover In addition we forged ahead with our global expansion opening Private Bank offices in Paris and Frankfurt a new Wealth center in Hong Kong and a Citi Global Wealth at Work presence in Luxembourg Greater connectivity and focus A centerpiece of our goforward plan is increasing the linkages between our businesses so we can more easily engage clients in one part of our firm with products and services from another By delivering the full power of Citi to clients we can deepen existing relationships and win new mandates Our Markets and Banking businesses are now aligned more closely than ever and as a result we are supporting our clients in a more integrated way Our Wealth business is also benefiting from closer connections and received more than 60000 referrals from the Retail Bank last year In addition we have established a new partnership agreement between Wealth and our Commercial Bank where 90 of our clients are privately owned companies At the same time we are making progress in simplifying our firm making us easier to manage and allowing us to focus on the parts of our business where we know we can grow and improve our competitiveness We announced our intention to exit 14 consumer businesses in Asia Europe the Middle East and Mexico \u2014 businesses that do not have clear synergies with our global network As a result of swift but disciplined execution in 2022 we successfully closed the sale of our consumer businesses in Australia Bahrain Malaysia the Philippines and Thailand In March 2023 we closed the sale of our consumer businesses in India and Vietnam and are on track to close two additional markets by the end of the year We also are progressing with the winddown of our consumer business in Korea In addition to exiting our consumer and local commercial banking businesses in Russia we are actively ending nearly all institutional banking services in the country and by the second quarter of 2023 our only operations will be those necessary to fulfill any legal and regulatory obligations Apart from Russia Citi will continue to serve our clients and invest in these markets through our institutional franchise and our Wealth business Citi\u2019s Transformation For our strategy to unlock the greatest possible value we know we need to modernize our infrastructure so that we are scaled and agile and able to continue to deliver for our clients The consent orders issued in 2020 by the Federal Reserve Board and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency underscored how we had underinvested not only in parts of our infrastructure but also in our risk and controls environment and our data governance Last year we made progress in accelerating our work to address these gaps and simplify and modernize our operating model for the digital age This work is so consequential in nature that we call it our \u201cTransformation\u201d It remains my number one priority Whilst this is a multiyear journey we are already seeing the fruits of our labors We have dramatically streamlined our approval process for new products And new stress testing capabilities enable us to make faster betterinformed risk decisions This made a huge difference in how we have been able to minimize the impact of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine on all parts of our business Investments in our people and communities Ensuring we have a culture characterized by excellence and accountability underpins the success of our Transformation and broader vision for the firm Last year we launched a program Citi\u2019s New Way to help our colleagues adopt the everyday habits we need in order to operate with excellence We have also hardwired accountability into our firm by strengthening our performance management process and implementing a greater emphasis on financial returns rather than on revenues The diversity of the nearly 240000 people who work at Citi is a distinguishing aspect of our firm as is the diversity of our Board which is majority female We remain committed to a workplace that mirrors the communities we serve In 2022 we set new goals to increase the number of women and other underrepresented groups working at Citi These new goals follow our success in exceeding the threeyear goals we set in 2018 to increase the percentage of women in the firm globally and of Black talent in the US In another sign of our progress last year we celebrated the promotion of one of the largest and most diverse Managing Director classes in recent years Maintaining a workplace that is diverse equitable and inclusive is not only true to our values but key to our competitiveness Our commitment to advancing diversity equity and inclusion goes well beyond Citi\u2019s walls as we continue to use our resources as a global bank to take on some of society\u2019s toughest challenges We expanded the Citi Impact Fund to 500 million in support of diverse founders who are driving both financial and social returns And we delivered on our commitment to transparency and accountability by announcing the findings from an external review and audit of our 1 billion Action for Racial Equity initiative to help close the racial wealth gap We have also been a leader in reimagining the future of work Drawing on lessons learned during the pandemic we have institutionalized a hybrid work model for much of our firm This approach provides the flexibility that our people want whilst also ensuring we benefit from the inperson collaboration realtime coaching and apprenticeship that occurs only when we are physically together Everywhere you look around the firm there is an undeniable sense of momentum We have never been clearer about the bank we want to be and we have made significant progress over the past year in bringing this vision to life Through our relentless commitment to excellence we are changing the trajectory of Citi to close the gap with our competitors and deliver a new era of success for all our stakeholders

than four years ago Pfizer unveiled a new purpose Breakthroughs that change patients\u2019 lives Pfizer has always had a noble purpose rooted in our commitment to patients but we wanted to make our

purpose every day They have pursued impactful breakthroughs with the goal of dramatically changing the lives of patients for the better As a result of this unwavering commitment to innovation and patients 2022 was a simply remarkable year for our company on multiple fronts \u2022 We secured eight key regulatory approvals completed 13 regulatory submissions and initiated 10 pivotal study starts as we continue to advance our robust RD pipeline of potential breakthrough medicines and vaccines \u2022 We maintained our industryleading clinical success ratesi and further improved our cycle times

Leadership During the year we also continued to lead the battle against COVID19 As the virus continued to evolve Pfizer scientists were up to the challenge\u2014using our flexible mRNA platform to swiftly create a new vaccine candidate based on the emerging Omicron BA4 and BA5 subvariants By September our BA4BA5 adapted bivalent vaccine had been authorized by both the US Food and Drug Administration FDA and the European Medicines Agency EMA as a booster dose for ages 12 years and older By November both agencies had authorized it for 5 years of age and older Then in December the Omicron BA4BA5adapted bivalent COVID19 vaccine received FDA authorization as the third 3\u00b5g dose in the threedose primary series for children 6 months through 4 years of age We are proud to have

are even higher in several key markets outside the US We believe our bestinclass mRNA capability coupled with our proven and reliable manufacturing network will ensure we are well positioned to continue to adapt our vaccine as needed and get it to people around the world Our COVID19 oral treatment PAXLOVID\u00ae nirmatrelvir tablets and ritonavir tablets has shown to be an important complementary tool to vaccination strategies for the estimated 40 of the global population at high risk for progressing to severe diseasev PAXLOVID has demonstrated robust efficacy a consistent safety profile and potential to help mitigate the burden of COVID19 on patients and their families health systems and societyvi As of March 1 2023 we have shipped 44 million treatment courses to 63 countries around the world Leading the Charge for Equitable Access During the year we also took bold action to help ensure our breakthroughs get into the hands of those who need them We\u2019re living in a time when science is increasingly demonstrating the ability to take on the world\u2019s most devastating diseases Unfortunately there\u2019s a huge health equity gap in our world that determines which of us can access these innovations\u2014and which of us can\u2019t At Pfizer we are committed to helping close this gap as quickly as possible That\u2019s why we launched An Accord for a Healthier World Through this groundbreaking initiative Pfizer now offers on a notforprofit basis the full portfolio of medicines and vaccines for which we have global rights to 45 lowerincome countries\u2014with the hope of giving the 12 billion people living in these countries access to hundreds of lifesaving and lifechanging products that they couldn\u2019t access before But as we learned in the COVID19 vaccine rollout ensuring supply is only the first step to helping patients For this reason another key element of the Accord is collaborating with global health leaders to make improvements in diagnosis education infrastructure innovative financing and more Im proud to say that the first shipments of our products arrived in Rwanda in September 2022 and we are working with them and other governments\u2014including in Ghana Malawi and Senegal\u2014on future deliveries as well as health system improvements to help make sure our products reach those in need Here in the US I\u2019m equally proud of the important work being done by Pfizer\u2019s Multicultural Health Equity Collective which recently convened more than 100 health equity luminaries from across the US to engage in candid conversations about the drivers and impact of systemic racism on healthcare The dialogue highlighted creative solutions that are already starting to reduce health disparities in local communities across the country A Bright Future for Pfizer and for Patients Looking ahead Pfizer\u2019s future appears to be even brighter than our present We\u2019re in the midst of an 18month period during which we expect to have up to an unprecedented 19 new products or indications in the market Fifteen of these 19 are from our internal pipeline with the remaining four coming to Pfizer via recent business development deals These potential medicines and vaccines cut across a range of therapeutic areas and include candidates for multiple myeloma prostate cancer respiratory syncytial virus RSV flu pneumococcal disease migraine ulcerative colitis and sickle cell disease\u2014among others This represents a tremendous opportunity to improve health outcomes for patients around the world This is the promise of our science at work And of course we have many more potential vaccines and medicines in our pipeline with numerous launches expected in the 20242030 timeframe if successful in

than four years ago Pfizer unveiled a new purpose Breakthroughs that change patients\u2019 lives Pfizer has always had a noble purpose rooted in our commitment to patients but we wanted to make our purpose more memorable more inspiring and most important more actionable I am happy to say that in the 50 months since then Pfizer\u2019s more than 80000 colleagues around the world have lived this purpose every day They have pursued impactful breakthroughs with the goal of dramatically changing the lives of patients for the better As a result of this unwavering commitment to innovation and patients 2022 was a simply remarkable year for our company on multiple fronts \u2022 We secured eight key regulatory approvals completed 13 regulatory submissions and initiated 10 pivotal study starts as we continue to advance our robust RD pipeline of potential breakthrough medicines and vaccines \u2022 We maintained our industryleading clinical success ratesi and further improved our cycle times which already were among the industry\u2019s bestii and we did all of this while maintaining our high standards of quality safety and scientific rigor \u2022 We completed four acquisitions\u2014Arena Pharmaceuticals Biohaven Pharmaceuticals Global Blood Therapeutics and ReViral\u2014 which have further strengthened both our pipeline and our current portfolio of innovative offerings for patients \u2022 We were named to 10 different \u201cbest employer\u201d lists including those published by Forbes LinkedIn Glassdoor and others \u2022 We exceeded 100 billion in revenues for the first time in our 174year history \u2022 And most important more than 13 billion patients around the world were treated with our medicines and vaccinesiii A truly humbling achievement Maintaining Our COVID\u201319 Leadership During the year we also continued to lead the battle against COVID19 As the virus continued to evolve Pfizer scientists were up to the challenge\u2014using our flexible mRNA platform to swiftly create a new vaccine candidate based on the emerging Omicron BA4 and BA5 subvariants By September our BA4BA5 adapted bivalent vaccine had been authorized by both the US Food and Drug Administration FDA and the European Medicines Agency EMA as a booster dose for ages 12 years and older By November both agencies had authorized it for 5 years of age and older Then in December the Omicron BA4BA5adapted bivalent COVID19 vaccine received FDA authorization as the third 3\u00b5g dose in the threedose primary series for children 6 months through 4 years of age We are proud to have maintained our leadership position throughout the public health booster A Letter From Our Chairman  CEO Success rates for Phase 1 are based on a 3year rolling average 20202022 rates for Phase 2 and

boosters in the USiv\u2014which is a significant expansion on the booster share leadership position that we already held before the bivalent booster launch\u2014and our bivalent booster market shares are even higher in several key markets outside the US We believe our bestinclass mRNA capability coupled with our proven and reliable manufacturing network will ensure we are well positioned to continue to adapt our vaccine as needed and get it to people around the world Our COVID19 oral treatment PAXLOVID\u00ae nirmatrelvir tablets and ritonavir tablets has shown to be an important complementary tool to vaccination strategies for the estimated 40 of the global population at high risk for progressing to severe diseasev PAXLOVID has demonstrated robust efficacy a consistent safety profile and potential to help mitigate the burden of COVID19 on patients and their families health systems and societyvi As of March 1 2023 we have shipped 44 million treatment courses to 63 countries around the world Leading the Charge for Equitable Access During the year we also took bold action to help ensure our breakthroughs get into the hands of those who need them We\u2019re living in a time when science is increasingly demonstrating the ability to take on the world\u2019s most devastating diseases Unfortunately there\u2019s a huge health equity gap in our world that determines which of us can access these innovations\u2014and which of us can\u2019t At Pfizer we are committed to helping close this gap as quickly as possible That\u2019s why we launched An Accord for a Healthier World Through this groundbreaking initiative Pfizer now offers on a notforprofit basis the full portfolio of medicines and vaccines for which we have global rights to 45 lowerincome countries\u2014with the hope of giving the 12 billion people living in these countries access to hundreds of lifesaving and lifechanging products that they couldn\u2019t access before But as we learned in the COVID19 vaccine rollout ensuring supply is only the first step to helping patients For this reason another key element of the Accord is collaborating with global health leaders to make improvements in diagnosis education infrastructure innovative financing and more Im proud to say that the first shipments of our products arrived in Rwanda in September 2022 and we are working with them and other governments\u2014including in Ghana Malawi and Senegal\u2014on future deliveries as well as health system improvements to help make sure our products reach those in need Here in the US I\u2019m equally proud of the important work being done by Pfizer\u2019s Multicultural Health Equity Collective which recently convened more than 100 health equity luminaries from across the US to engage in candid conversations about the drivers and impact of systemic racism on healthcare The dialogue highlighted creative solutions that are already starting to reduce health disparities in local communities across the country A Bright Future for Pfizer and for Patients Looking ahead Pfizer\u2019s future appears to be even brighter than our present We\u2019re in the midst of an 18month period during which we expect to have up to an unprecedented 19 new products or indications in the market Fifteen of these 19 are from our internal pipeline with the remaining four coming to Pfizer via recent business development deals These potential medicines and vaccines cut across a range of therapeutic areas and include candidates for multiple myeloma prostate cancer respiratory syncytial virus RSV flu pneumococcal disease migraine ulcerative colitis and sickle cell disease\u2014among others This represents a tremendous opportunity to improve health outcomes for patients around the world This is the promise of our science at work And of course we have many more potential vaccines and medicines in our pipeline with numerous launches expected in the 20242030 timeframe if successful in clinical trials and approved Some of the most promising assets include our oral GLP1 candidate for diabetes and obesity potential combination vaccines for flu COVID19 and RSV our potential vaccines

high single digit growth rates for the MA industry through 20256 Medicare Advantage with its strong demographic growth and superior value proposition provides significant growth opportunity ahead Currently there are 594 million Medicareeligible individuals in the United States2 Thanks to strong demographic growth tailwinds this addressable market will continue to grow and by 2030 one in five US residents will reach retirement age3 When customers age into Medicare eligibility they have a choice to either enroll in an MA plan or the Original Medicare program We believe customers choose an MA product in large part because of the exceptional clinical outcomes and enhanced value proposition MA members have 43 fewer avoidable hospitalizations than Original Medicare and MA products provide 184 of additional benefits relative to Original Medicare on average nationally7 It is also noteworthy that MA plans meaningfully over index in supporting underserved populations with a majority of Hispanic Americans and nearly half of African Americans choosing an MA product8 In addition 39 of individuals eligible for Dual Eligible Special Needs Plan DSNP are enrolled in a DSNP plan as of January 2023 up from 22 at the end of 20189 2 Our ability to continue to provide better outcomes for our members and patients while also delivering compelling returns to our stockholders is underpinned by strong fundamentals in the MA industry and bolstered by Humana\u2019s differentiated capabilities and growing payer agnostic CenterWell platform along with our continued discipline in

including our industryleading valuebased care portfolio our superior clinical quality solutions and our differentiated customercentric operations Humana\u2019s highly diversified valuebased care

valuebased clinical and operating model Our partnership model includes options such as partial or full risk alliance and joint venture models where we invest in growth together Humana has a robust people process and technology infrastructure to help providers succeed in valuebased care arrangements We continue to work to increase the penetration of valuebased primary care models given the improved quality and health outcomes these models consistently deliver Based on 2021 data members supported by valuebased providers experienced 9 fewer trips to the emergency room and overall 251000 fewer days in the hospital These models also deliver superior economic outcomes reducing total medical costs by an estimated 201 or 6 billion as compared to the same members had they been enrolled in Original Medicare11 The higher quality and lower costs associated with valuebased primary care creates a virtuous cycle allowing us to invest cost savings into additional benefits for our members driving greater plan satisfaction retention and growth at or above industry levels This is reflected in our plan designs where members associated with valuebased providers receive over 500 more in plan benefits on average annually These improved experiences and strong value proposition also result in higher relational Net Promoter Score\u00ae NPS\u00ae and retention We were proud to close 2022 with 70 of our individual MA members being supported by a valuebased provider who is incentivized to comprehensively and proactively manage patient needs leading to improved health outcomes and lower total cost of care 4 0 0 77 We have been recognized as leading the industry in member satisfaction and are proud that Humana has been named the Best Overall Medicare Advantage Insurance Company by US News and World Report which created an honor roll based on the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services\u2019 2023 Star Ratings for Medicare Advantage plans Additionally Humana was rated as the best company for member experience and best company for lowpremium plan availability In 2021 members supported by valuebased providers had an 8point higher NPS versus those supported by feeforservice providers while retention was 14 higher The provider also benefits from these models where physicians practicing under valuebased models earn 143 cents of every healthcare dollar compared to 64 cents for nonvaluebased physicians11 Our ability to maintain our leadership position in the MA industry is also supported by our excellence in quality and customer experiences Our success is demonstrated in areas such as Star Ratings where 96 of our MA members are enrolled in plans rated 4 stars and above for bonus year 202412 Humana has now achieved the highest percentage of members in 4plus Star contracts across all our national competitors for five consecutive years The success and capability leadership we\u2019ve experienced is enabled and sustained by consistent operational excellence and industryleading consumer experience 5 We remain the largest seniorfocused valuebased primary care platform in the United States closing 2022 with 235 centers a 14 yearoveryear increase Our centers which operate under the CenterWell and Conviva brands were staffed by 671 primary care providers serving over 191000 Medicare patients at the end of 2022 Humana MA members comprised approximately half of the de novo center panel while comprising over 70 of our whollyowned center panel Our valuebased primary care model focuses on personalized patient experience and health outcomes that will continue to reshape how care is provided to seniors The feeforservice system oriented to specialized episodic care is not well structured to meet the needs of an aging population with an increasing chronic disease prevalence where more than half of seniors have two or more chronic conditions and more than 30 of older Americans have social determinant barriers to health1314 This has contributed to critical challenges in senior care including rising costs and complexity poor outcomes and poor access to care CenterWell Senior Primary Care Valuebased primary care is uniquely positioned to solve these problems combining the trust and influence of the primary care physicianpatient relationship and a revenue model that rewards investment in proactive longitudinal care When compared to a feeforservice provider model our valuebased primary care model is oriented to smaller patient panels offers afterhours and same day appointments longer appointment times proactive preventative appointment scheduling and utilizes a multidisciplinary care team all of which is designed to drive improved quality and health outcomes United under the CenterWell brand we have significantly expanded our payer agnostic healthcare services capabilities including our seniorfocused primary care pharmacy and home care offerings We will continue to invest in our growing CenterWell assets and our ability to increase use of these capabilities by our health plan members while also increasing our total addressable market unlocking the potential to drive significant Enterprise earnings and margin growth And as we evolve and accelerate our strategy for continued leadership in an industry that is shifting rapidly toward valuebased care we expect that our CenterWell healthcare services will be an increasingly important contributor to our longterm growth Our Primary Care Organization continues to improve the operating performance in our whollyowned centers and we are pleased to report that we increased the number of centers that are contribution margin positive from 88 at the end of 2021 to 110 at yearend 2022 a 25 increase yearoveryear 6 In addition we increased the number of centers that have reached our 3 million contribution margin target from 18 in 2021 to 31 at the end of 2022 We have also demonstrated compelling member satisfaction with an NPS of 80 and favorable health outcomes with inpatient admits per thousand and emergency department visits per thousand running 43 and 72 lower than Original Medicare respectively151617 Our marketleading differentiated provider asset is well positioned for continued center expansion and patient panel growth and is expected to be a meaningful contributor to Enterprise earnings in the future Through accelerated de novo center expansion programmatic small and midsize merger and acquisition activity and improved organic growth in our whollyowned centers we anticipate expanding our number of centers by approximately 30 to 50 centers annually over the next several years and are targeting Medicare patient compounded annual growth of 18 to 20 Looking ahead we expect to have 400 to 450 centers serving approximately 450000 patients by 2025 18 With this growth we anticipate a contribution of approximately 100 million  200 million EBITDA from our Primary Care Organization in 2025 growing to more than 1 billion over the next 10 years 7 The strength of our core feeforservice home health business was evident in 2022 with total same store admissions up 63 yearoveryear compared to public peer growth of 07520 We have also grown the CenterWell Home Health\u2122 penetration rate of Humana home health episodes in markets where there is geographic overlap from 8 in 2017 when we entered into our initial transaction with Kindred at Home now CenterWell Home Health to 19 in 202221 We are confident we can significantly increase this volume in the years to come CenterWell Home Health We expect our home health admission growth to continue in the midsingle digits in 2023 as we look to offset the declining Original Medicare market with increased penetration of MA patients including Humana MA members In addition CenterWell Home Health is focused on increasing nursing capacity through recruiting and retention initiatives Our voluntary nursing turnover improved from 319 in 2021 to 306 in 2022 We continue to invest in clinical orientation and mentors as well as technology focused on reducing administrative tasks and drive time for clinicians\u2014which we expect to drive further improvement in nurse recruitment and retention Beyond growing our core feeforservice home business we are focused on providing members and patients with access to holistic valuebased care in the home that enhances the experience improves outcomes and reduces total cost of care Our valuebased home model which coordinates care and optimizes spend across home health durable medical equipment DME and infusion services is now supporting approximately 15 of our MA members\u2014up from 5 coverage in 2021 In addition we are implementing some of these capabilities on a standalone basis to accelerate value creation As of January 2023 we rolled out the home health utilization management and network management capabilities to 14 million additional members bringing the total number of covered members to 19 million creating incremental Enterprise value in advance of the full valuebased market rollout With approximately 6 market share19 CenterWell Home Health is the largest home health provider in the United States and we are well positioned to continue to grow our core home health business going forward 8 1 million additional members by year end 2023 Looking forward we expect to expand coverage of the full valuebased home model to approximately Today on average health plans in Humana markets with the greatest opportunity spend 35 to 40 per member per month on home health DME and infusion combined We believe the valuebased home health model can reduce these costs for the Enterprise by a net 10 to 15 thereby generating between 110 million to 150 million of incremental annual Enterprise value creation by 2025 800000 of which are currently served under the utilization and network management model and are on track to cover approximately 40 of our MA members with the full valuebased model by 2025 9 Our pharmacy dispensing business remains strong with industryleading mailorder penetration at 386 for our individual MA members in 2022 In addition in more mature CenterWell clinics we have seen mailorder penetration rates for Humana members approach 50 and when combined with prescriptions dispensed by our colocated retail pharmacies our total CenterWell Pharmacy\u2122 market share can approach 60 The benefits of mailorder extend beyond our pharmacy operations leading to better medication adherence and health outcomes benefiting our members and health plan As an example MA members who utilize CenterWell Pharmacy demonstrate medication adherence rates ranging from 650 to 840 basis points higher than we see in traditional retail pharmacies for cholesterol blood pressure and diabetes treatments CenterWell Pharmacy Integrating our CenterWell assets As we look to the long term the growth and maturation of our CenterWell assets are expected to bolster our ability to continue to drive compelling earnings growth and increased cash flow creating additional capital deployment opportunities This time period will also allow for the maturation of the potential benefits from the advancement of the integration of our assets in local markets When we integrate our assets effectively in local markets we see accelerated volume growth better experiences and clinical outcomes and improved Humana Enterprise economics With a health plan member utilizing the full suite of CenterWell assets we can drive two to four times the direct margin dollars for the Enterprise versus one that utilizes the health plan alone In addition we believe successful integration of our assets can drive additional value in areas such as improved retention and higher Stars scores which we have not attempted to estimate in the two to four times metric We believe there is the potential to unlock significant value over time as our integration efforts mature and look forward to providing updates in the future Our pharmacy business will benefit from the significant growth in individual MA membership in 2023 as we anticipate maintaining our industryleading mailorder position further investing in the consumer experience and encouraging the continued use of mailorder despite comparable copays in the retail setting beginning in 2023 10 11 Environmental social and governance We\u2019re continuously working to ensure that our health plan products and services are as affordable as possible while also creating pathways for access to healthcare addressing social determinants of health SDOH and healthrelated social needs Thanks to processes such as integrated care delivery and using health screenings that consider SDOH and health literacy we have a clearer view of each member\u2019s very personal barriers to their best health Through use of our proprietary population health analytics capabilities we\u2019re able to aggregate and stratify more than 90 data sets to help us learn even more about the unique factors impacting a person\u2019s total health recognizing that helping them with their health often requires addressing environmental conditions and social and lifestyle factors housing education employment etc that prevent them from getting and staying well Building trust and taking care of people has always been core to our values and our company\u2019s purpose and mission As we meet people where they are and make things simpler for them we begin to establish trust which gives us the permission space to help them achieve their best health That\u2019s where real transformational change begins We know that our role in healthcare goes beyond being a good corporate citizen For us to have sustainable success as a company we need to

clinicians community partners and national leaders we\u2019re able to \u201ctreat\u201d social needs and expand community capacity to address SDOH Many of these undertakings involve deep community collaborations such as establishing a process to screen patients for food insecurity in their doctor\u2019s office and immediately connect them to a local food bank for entitlement program enrollment and emergency food provision Measuring our progress and addressing opportunities is critical to achieving our strategy and creating value We know that\u2019s how we continue to build trust with all of

successful execution of our 1 billion valuecreation plan a return to abovemarket individual Medicare Advantage MA membership growth for 2023 and further advancement of our CenterWell\u2122 platform The strong earnings growth delivered in 2022 combined with the robust membership growth and financial outlook for 2023 increases our confidence in our midterm Adjusted earnings per share target of 37 in 2025 Strong industry fundamentals As an industry leader in seniorfocused integrated valuebased care delivering higherquality outcomes at a lower cost Humana is well positioned in the fastest growing segment in healthcare which will drive significant value in the mid and longterm Dear fellow stockholders This penetration rate is up 1200 basis points from 2018 to January 2023 and we expect high single digit growth rates for the MA industry through 20256 Medicare Advantage with its strong demographic growth and superior value proposition provides significant growth opportunity ahead Currently there are 594 million Medicareeligible individuals in the United States2 Thanks to strong demographic growth tailwinds this addressable market will continue to grow and by 2030 one in five US residents will reach retirement age3 When customers age into Medicare eligibility they have a choice to either enroll in an MA plan or the Original Medicare program We believe customers choose an MA product in large part because of the exceptional clinical outcomes and enhanced value proposition MA members have 43 fewer avoidable hospitalizations than Original Medicare and MA products provide 184 of additional benefits relative to Original Medicare on average nationally7 It is also noteworthy that MA plans meaningfully over index in supporting underserved populations with a majority of Hispanic Americans and nearly half of African Americans choosing an MA product8 In addition 39 of individuals eligible for Dual Eligible Special Needs Plan DSNP are enrolled in a DSNP plan as of January 2023 up from 22 at the end of 20189 2 Our ability to continue to provide better outcomes for our members and patients while also delivering compelling returns to our stockholders is underpinned by strong fundamentals in the MA industry and bolstered by Humana\u2019s differentiated capabilities and growing payer agnostic CenterWell platform along with our continued discipline in and focus on productivity and operating efficiencies KURT HILZINGER Chairman of the Board BRUCE BROUSSARD President and Chief Executive Officer 3 Humana\u2019s growth in MA has outpaced the industry historically with compounded annual growth CAGR of 104 between 2018 and 2022 while the industry grew at a rate of 97 over the same period10 In addition we expect growth of at least 5000 individual MA members for 2023 representing annual growth of 1  7  meaningfully outpacing industry growth This strong track record of aboveindustry growth is supported by our differentiated MA capabilities including our industryleading valuebased care portfolio our superior clinical quality solutions and our differentiated customercentric operations Humana\u2019s highly diversified valuebased care solutions and locally oriented provider relationship models set us apart from our competitors Humana\u2019s differentiated capabilities 104 1  7  Humana\u2019s expected individual MA membership growth in 2023 Humana\u2019s 2018 to 2022 MA Membership CAGR We support a wide range of valuebased models and customized solutions to support providers wherever they are in their journey of migrating to a valuebased clinical and operating model Our partnership model includes options such as partial or full risk alliance and joint venture models where we invest in growth together Humana has a robust people process and technology infrastructure to help providers succeed in valuebased care arrangements We continue to work to increase the penetration of valuebased primary care models given the improved quality and health outcomes these models consistently deliver Based on 2021 data members supported by valuebased providers experienced 9 fewer trips to the emergency room and overall 251000 fewer days in the hospital These models also deliver superior economic outcomes reducing total medical costs by an estimated 201 or 6 billion as compared to the same members had they been enrolled in Original Medicare11 The higher quality and lower costs associated with valuebased primary care creates a virtuous cycle allowing us to invest cost savings into additional benefits for our members driving greater plan satisfaction retention and growth at or above industry levels This is reflected in our plan designs where members associated with valuebased providers receive over 500 more in plan benefits on average annually These improved experiences and strong value proposition also result in higher relational Net Promoter Score\u00ae NPS\u00ae and retention We were proud to close 2022 with 70 of our individual MA members being supported by a valuebased provider who is incentivized to comprehensively and proactively manage patient needs leading to improved health outcomes and lower total cost of care 4 0 0 77 We have been recognized as leading the industry in member satisfaction and are proud that Humana has been named the Best Overall Medicare Advantage Insurance Company by US News and World Report which created an honor roll based on the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services\u2019 2023 Star Ratings for Medicare Advantage plans Additionally Humana was rated as the best company for member experience and best company for lowpremium plan availability In 2021 members supported by valuebased providers had an 8point higher NPS versus those supported by feeforservice providers while retention was 14 higher The provider also benefits from these models where physicians practicing under valuebased models earn 143 cents of every healthcare dollar compared to 64 cents for nonvaluebased physicians11 Our ability to maintain our leadership position in the MA industry is also supported by our excellence in quality and customer experiences Our success is demonstrated in areas such as Star Ratings where 96 of our MA members are enrolled in plans rated 4 stars and above for bonus year 202412 Humana has now achieved the highest percentage of members in 4plus Star contracts across all our national competitors for five consecutive years The success and capability leadership we\u2019ve experienced is enabled and sustained by consistent operational excellence and industryleading consumer experience 5 We remain the largest seniorfocused valuebased primary care platform in the United States closing 2022 with 235 centers a 14 yearoveryear increase Our centers which operate under the CenterWell and Conviva brands were staffed by 671 primary care providers serving over 191000 Medicare patients at the end of 2022 Humana MA members comprised approximately half of the de novo center panel while comprising over 70 of our whollyowned center panel Our valuebased primary care model focuses on personalized patient experience and health outcomes that will continue to reshape how care is provided to seniors The feeforservice system oriented to specialized episodic care is not well structured to meet the needs of an aging population with an increasing chronic disease prevalence where more than half of seniors have two or more chronic conditions and more than 30 of older Americans have social determinant barriers to health1314 This has contributed to critical challenges in senior care including rising costs and complexity poor outcomes and poor access to care CenterWell Senior Primary Care Valuebased primary care is uniquely positioned to solve these problems combining the trust and influence of the primary care physicianpatient relationship and a revenue model that rewards investment in proactive longitudinal care When compared to a feeforservice provider model our valuebased primary care model is oriented to smaller patient panels offers afterhours and same day appointments longer appointment times proactive preventative appointment scheduling and utilizes a multidisciplinary care team all of which is designed to drive improved quality and health outcomes United under the CenterWell brand we have significantly expanded our payer agnostic healthcare services capabilities including our seniorfocused primary care pharmacy and home care offerings We will continue to invest in our growing CenterWell assets and our ability to increase use of these capabilities by our health plan members while also increasing our total addressable market unlocking the potential to drive significant Enterprise earnings and margin growth And as we evolve and accelerate our strategy for continued leadership in an industry that is shifting rapidly toward valuebased care we expect that our CenterWell healthcare services will be an increasingly important contributor to our longterm growth Our Primary Care Organization continues to improve the operating performance in our whollyowned centers and we are pleased to report that we increased the number of centers that are contribution margin positive from 88 at the end of 2021 to 110 at yearend 2022 a 25 increase yearoveryear 6 In addition we increased the number of centers that have reached our 3 million contribution margin target from 18 in 2021 to 31 at the end of 2022 We have also demonstrated compelling member satisfaction with an NPS of 80 and favorable health outcomes with inpatient admits per thousand and emergency department visits per thousand running 43 and 72 lower than Original Medicare respectively151617 Our marketleading differentiated provider asset is well positioned for continued center expansion and patient panel growth and is expected to be a meaningful contributor to Enterprise earnings in the future Through accelerated de novo center expansion programmatic small and midsize merger and acquisition activity and improved organic growth in our whollyowned centers we anticipate expanding our number of centers by approximately 30 to 50 centers annually over the next several years and are targeting Medicare patient compounded annual growth of 18 to 20 Looking ahead we expect to have 400 to 450 centers serving approximately 450000 patients by 2025 18 With this growth we anticipate a contribution of approximately 100 million  200 million EBITDA from our Primary Care Organization in 2025 growing to more than 1 billion over the next 10 years 7 The strength of our core feeforservice home health business was evident in 2022 with total same store admissions up 63 yearoveryear compared to public peer growth of 07520 We have also grown the CenterWell Home Health\u2122 penetration rate of Humana home health episodes in markets where there is geographic overlap from 8 in 2017 when we entered into our initial transaction with Kindred at Home now CenterWell Home Health to 19 in 202221 We are confident we can significantly increase this volume in the years to come CenterWell Home Health We expect our home health admission growth to continue in the midsingle digits in 2023 as we look to offset the declining Original Medicare market with increased penetration of MA patients including Humana MA members In addition CenterWell Home Health is focused on increasing nursing capacity through recruiting and retention initiatives Our voluntary nursing turnover improved from 319 in 2021 to 306 in 2022 We continue to invest in clinical orientation and mentors as well as technology focused on reducing administrative tasks and drive time for clinicians\u2014which we expect to drive further improvement in nurse recruitment and retention Beyond growing our core feeforservice home business we are focused on providing members and patients with access to holistic valuebased care in the home that enhances the experience improves outcomes and reduces total cost of care Our valuebased home model which coordinates care and optimizes spend across home health durable medical equipment DME and infusion services is now supporting approximately 15 of our MA members\u2014up from 5 coverage in 2021 In addition we are implementing some of these capabilities on a standalone basis to accelerate value creation As of January 2023 we rolled out the home health utilization management and network management capabilities to 14 million additional members bringing the total number of covered members to 19 million creating incremental Enterprise value in advance of the full valuebased market rollout With approximately 6 market share19 CenterWell Home Health is the largest home health provider in the United States and we are well positioned to continue to grow our core home health business going forward 8 1 million additional members by year end 2023 Looking forward we expect to expand coverage of the full valuebased home model to approximately Today on average health plans in Humana markets with the greatest opportunity spend 35 to 40 per member per month on home health DME and infusion combined We believe the valuebased home health model can reduce these costs for the Enterprise by a net 10 to 15 thereby generating between 110 million to 150 million of incremental annual Enterprise value creation by 2025 800000 of which are currently served under the utilization and network management model and are on track to cover approximately 40 of our MA members with the full valuebased model by 2025 9 Our pharmacy dispensing business remains strong with industryleading mailorder penetration at 386 for our individual MA members in 2022 In addition in more mature CenterWell clinics we have seen mailorder penetration rates for Humana members approach 50 and when combined with prescriptions dispensed by our colocated retail pharmacies our total CenterWell Pharmacy\u2122 market share can approach 60 The benefits of mailorder extend beyond our pharmacy operations leading to better medication adherence and health outcomes benefiting our members and health plan As an example MA members who utilize CenterWell Pharmacy demonstrate medication adherence rates ranging from 650 to 840 basis points higher than we see in traditional retail pharmacies for cholesterol blood pressure and diabetes treatments CenterWell Pharmacy Integrating our CenterWell assets As we look to the long term the growth and maturation of our CenterWell assets are expected to bolster our ability to continue to drive compelling earnings growth and increased cash flow creating additional capital deployment opportunities This time period will also allow for the maturation of the potential benefits from the advancement of the integration of our assets in local markets When we integrate our assets effectively in local markets we see accelerated volume growth better experiences and clinical outcomes and improved Humana Enterprise economics With a health plan member utilizing the full suite of CenterWell assets we can drive two to four times the direct margin dollars for the Enterprise versus one that utilizes the health plan alone In addition we believe successful integration of our assets can drive additional value in areas such as improved retention and higher Stars scores which we have not attempted to estimate in the two to four times metric We believe there is the potential to unlock significant value over time as our integration efforts mature and look forward to providing updates in the future Our pharmacy business will benefit from the significant growth in individual MA membership in 2023 as we anticipate maintaining our industryleading mailorder position further investing in the consumer experience and encouraging the continued use of mailorder despite comparable copays in the retail setting beginning in 2023 10 11 Environmental social and governance We\u2019re continuously working to ensure that our health plan products and services are as affordable as possible while also creating pathways for access to healthcare addressing social determinants of health SDOH and healthrelated social needs Thanks to processes such as integrated care delivery and using health screenings that consider SDOH and health literacy we have a clearer view of each member\u2019s very personal barriers to their best health Through use of our proprietary population health analytics capabilities we\u2019re able to aggregate and stratify more than 90 data sets to help us learn even more about the unique factors impacting a person\u2019s total health recognizing that helping them with their health often requires addressing environmental conditions and social and lifestyle factors housing education employment etc that prevent them from getting and staying well Building trust and taking care of people has always been core to our values and our company\u2019s purpose and mission As we meet people where they are and make things simpler for them we begin to establish trust which gives us the permission space to help them achieve their best health That\u2019s where real transformational change begins We know that our role in healthcare goes beyond being a good corporate citizen For us to have sustainable success as a company we need to not only have satisfied customers and associates but we must also contribute to society by tackling larger issues that stand in the way of healthy communities We are dedicated to improving the health of every person we serve demonstrated through our environmental social and governance ESG strategy\u2014to improve the health of each person each community the healthcare system and our environment\u2014 and it\u2019s our steadfast belief that everyone should have access to the resources and support they need to reach their full health potential 12 With over 60 years of healthcare experience our ability to impact the healthcare system has only grown We take this responsibility seriously by adopting bestpractice governance and business policies following rigorous quality and ethical standards working closely with healthcare providers and innovating on behalf of those we serve We understand that 60 of one\u2019s ability to lead a healthy meaningful life is shaped by environmental conditions and sociallifestyle factors We\u2019re leaning into that In our communities we support the dedicated people and organizations at the forefront of community health helping accelerate their reach and impact These collaborations move us towards the goals of eliminating social and structural barriers to health to achieve health equity Working closely with physicians clinicians community partners and national leaders we\u2019re able to \u201ctreat\u201d social needs and expand community capacity to address SDOH Many of these undertakings involve deep community collaborations such as establishing a process to screen patients for food insecurity in their doctor\u2019s office and immediately connect them to a local food bank for entitlement program enrollment and emergency food provision Measuring our progress and addressing opportunities is critical to achieving our strategy and creating value We know that\u2019s how we continue to build trust with all of our stakeholders and is why we are committed to transparent reporting on our ESG measures presenting both our progress and our shortcomings in our annual Impact Report We encourage you to read about

successful execution of our 1 billion valuecreation plan a return to abovemarket individual Medicare Advantage MA membership growth for 2023 and further advancement of our CenterWell\u2122 platform The strong earnings growth delivered in 2022 combined with the robust membership growth and financial outlook for 2023 increases our confidence in our midterm Adjusted earnings per share target of 37 in 2025 Strong industry fundamentals As an industry leader in seniorfocused integrated valuebased care delivering higherquality outcomes at a lower cost Humana is well positioned in the fastest growing segment in healthcare which will drive significant value in the mid and longterm Dear fellow stockholders This penetration rate is up 1200 basis points from 2018 to January 2023 and we expect high single digit growth rates for the MA industry through 20256 Medicare Advantage with its strong demographic growth and superior value proposition provides significant growth opportunity ahead Currently there are 594 million Medicareeligible individuals in the United States2 Thanks to strong demographic growth tailwinds this addressable market will continue to grow and by 2030 one in five US residents will reach retirement age3 When customers age into Medicare eligibility they have a choice to either enroll in an MA plan or the Original Medicare program We believe customers choose an MA product in large part because of the exceptional clinical outcomes and enhanced value proposition MA members have 43 fewer avoidable hospitalizations than Original Medicare and MA products provide 184 of additional benefits relative to Original Medicare on average nationally7 It is also noteworthy that MA plans meaningfully over index in supporting underserved populations with a majority of Hispanic Americans and nearly half of African Americans choosing an MA product8 In addition 39 of individuals eligible for Dual Eligible Special Needs Plan DSNP are enrolled in a DSNP plan as of January 2023 up from 22 at the end of 20189 2 Our ability to continue to provide better outcomes for our members and patients while also delivering compelling returns to our stockholders is underpinned by strong fundamentals in the MA industry and bolstered by Humana\u2019s differentiated capabilities and growing payer agnostic CenterWell platform along with our continued discipline in and focus on productivity and operating efficiencies KURT HILZINGER Chairman of the Board BRUCE BROUSSARD President and Chief Executive Officer 3 Humana\u2019s growth in MA has outpaced the industry historically with compounded annual growth CAGR of 104 between 2018 and 2022 while the industry grew at a rate of 97 over the same period10 In addition we expect growth of at least 5000 individual MA members for 2023 representing annual growth of 1  7  meaningfully outpacing industry growth This strong track record of aboveindustry growth is supported by our differentiated MA capabilities including our industryleading valuebased care portfolio our superior clinical quality solutions and our differentiated customercentric operations Humana\u2019s highly diversified valuebased care solutions and locally oriented provider relationship models set us apart from our competitors Humana\u2019s differentiated capabilities 104 1  7  Humana\u2019s expected individual MA membership growth in 2023 Humana\u2019s 2018 to 2022 MA Membership CAGR We support a wide range of valuebased models and customized solutions to support providers wherever they are in their journey of migrating to a valuebased clinical and operating model Our partnership model includes options such as partial or full risk alliance and joint venture models where we invest in growth together Humana has a robust people process and technology infrastructure to help providers succeed in valuebased care arrangements We continue to work to increase the penetration of valuebased primary care models given the improved quality and health outcomes these models consistently deliver Based on 2021 data members supported by valuebased providers experienced 9 fewer trips to the emergency room and overall 251000 fewer days in the hospital These models also deliver superior economic outcomes reducing total medical costs by an estimated 201 or 6 billion as compared to the same members had they been enrolled in Original Medicare11 The higher quality and lower costs associated with valuebased primary care creates a virtuous cycle allowing us to invest cost savings into additional benefits for our members driving greater plan satisfaction retention and growth at or above industry levels This is reflected in our plan designs where members associated with valuebased providers receive over 500 more in plan benefits on average annually These improved experiences and strong value proposition also result in higher relational Net Promoter Score\u00ae NPS\u00ae and retention We were proud to close 2022 with 70 of our individual MA members being supported by a valuebased provider who is incentivized to comprehensively and proactively manage patient needs leading to improved health outcomes and lower total cost of care 4 0 0 77 We have been recognized as leading the industry in member satisfaction and are proud that Humana has been named the Best Overall Medicare Advantage Insurance Company by US News and World Report which created an honor roll based on the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services\u2019 2023 Star Ratings for Medicare Advantage plans Additionally Humana was rated as the best company for member experience and best company for lowpremium plan availability In 2021 members supported by valuebased providers had an 8point higher NPS versus those supported by feeforservice providers while retention was 14 higher The provider also benefits from these models where physicians practicing under valuebased models earn 143 cents of every healthcare dollar compared to 64 cents for nonvaluebased physicians11 Our ability to maintain our leadership position in the MA industry is also supported by our excellence in quality and customer experiences Our success is demonstrated in areas such as Star Ratings where 96 of our MA members are enrolled in plans rated 4 stars and above for bonus year 202412 Humana has now achieved the highest percentage of members in 4plus Star contracts across all our national competitors for five consecutive years The success and capability leadership we\u2019ve experienced is enabled and sustained by consistent operational excellence and industryleading consumer experience 5 We remain the largest seniorfocused valuebased primary care platform in the United States closing 2022 with 235 centers a 14 yearoveryear increase Our centers which operate under the CenterWell and Conviva brands were staffed by 671 primary care providers serving over 191000 Medicare patients at the end of 2022 Humana MA members comprised approximately half of the de novo center panel while comprising over 70 of our whollyowned center panel Our valuebased primary care model focuses on personalized patient experience and health outcomes that will continue to reshape how care is provided to seniors The feeforservice system oriented to specialized episodic care is not well structured to meet the needs of an aging population with an increasing chronic disease prevalence where more than half of seniors have two or more chronic conditions and more than 30 of older Americans have social determinant barriers to health1314 This has contributed to critical challenges in senior care including rising costs and complexity poor outcomes and poor access to care CenterWell Senior Primary Care Valuebased primary care is uniquely positioned to solve these problems combining the trust and influence of the primary care physicianpatient relationship and a revenue model that rewards investment in proactive longitudinal care When compared to a feeforservice provider model our valuebased primary care model is oriented to smaller patient panels offers afterhours and same day appointments longer appointment times proactive preventative appointment scheduling and utilizes a multidisciplinary care team all of which is designed to drive improved quality and health outcomes United under the CenterWell brand we have significantly expanded our payer agnostic healthcare services capabilities including our seniorfocused primary care pharmacy and home care offerings We will continue to invest in our growing CenterWell assets and our ability to increase use of these capabilities by our health plan members while also increasing our total addressable market unlocking the potential to drive significant Enterprise earnings and margin growth And as we evolve and accelerate our strategy for continued leadership in an industry that is shifting rapidly toward valuebased care we expect that our CenterWell healthcare services will be an increasingly important contributor to our longterm growth Our Primary Care Organization continues to improve the operating performance in our whollyowned centers and we are pleased to report that we increased the number of centers that are contribution margin positive from 88 at the end of 2021 to 110 at yearend 2022 a 25 increase yearoveryear 6 In addition we increased the number of centers that have reached our 3 million contribution margin target from 18 in 2021 to 31 at the end of 2022 We have also demonstrated compelling member satisfaction with an NPS of 80 and favorable health outcomes with inpatient admits per thousand and emergency department visits per thousand running 43 and 72 lower than Original Medicare respectively151617 Our marketleading differentiated provider asset is well positioned for continued center expansion and patient panel growth and is expected to be a meaningful contributor to Enterprise earnings in the future Through accelerated de novo center expansion programmatic small and midsize merger and acquisition activity and improved organic growth in our whollyowned centers we anticipate expanding our number of centers by approximately 30 to 50 centers annually over the next several years and are targeting Medicare patient compounded annual growth of 18 to 20 Looking ahead we expect to have 400 to 450 centers serving approximately 450000 patients by 2025 18 With this growth we anticipate a contribution of approximately 100 million  200 million EBITDA from our Primary Care Organization in 2025 growing to more than 1 billion over the next 10 years 7 The strength of our core feeforservice home health business was evident in 2022 with total same store admissions up 63 yearoveryear compared to public peer growth of 07520 We have also grown the CenterWell Home Health\u2122 penetration rate of Humana home health episodes in markets where there is geographic overlap from 8 in 2017 when we entered into our initial transaction with Kindred at Home now CenterWell Home Health to 19 in 202221 We are confident we can significantly increase this volume in the years to come CenterWell Home Health We expect our home health admission growth to continue in the midsingle digits in 2023 as we look to offset the declining Original Medicare market with increased penetration of MA patients including Humana MA members In addition CenterWell Home Health is focused on increasing nursing capacity through recruiting and retention initiatives Our voluntary nursing turnover improved from 319 in 2021 to 306 in 2022 We continue to invest in clinical orientation and mentors as well as technology focused on reducing administrative tasks and drive time for clinicians\u2014which we expect to drive further improvement in nurse recruitment and retention Beyond growing our core feeforservice home business we are focused on providing members and patients with access to holistic valuebased care in the home that enhances the experience improves outcomes and reduces total cost of care Our valuebased home model which coordinates care and optimizes spend across home health durable medical equipment DME and infusion services is now supporting approximately 15 of our MA members\u2014up from 5 coverage in 2021 In addition we are implementing some of these capabilities on a standalone basis to accelerate value creation As of January 2023 we rolled out the home health utilization management and network management capabilities to 14 million additional members bringing the total number of covered members to 19 million creating incremental Enterprise value in advance of the full valuebased market rollout With approximately 6 market share19 CenterWell Home Health is the largest home health provider in the United States and we are well positioned to continue to grow our core home health business going forward 8 1 million additional members by year end 2023 Looking forward we expect to expand coverage of the full valuebased home model to approximately Today on average health plans in Humana markets with the greatest opportunity spend 35 to 40 per member per month on home health DME and infusion combined We believe the valuebased home health model can reduce these costs for the Enterprise by a net 10 to 15 thereby generating between 110 million to 150 million of incremental annual Enterprise value creation by 2025 800000 of which are currently served under the utilization and network management model and are on track to cover approximately 40 of our MA members with the full valuebased model by 2025 9 Our pharmacy dispensing business remains strong with industryleading mailorder penetration at 386 for our individual MA members in 2022 In addition in more mature CenterWell clinics we have seen mailorder penetration rates for Humana members approach 50 and when combined with prescriptions dispensed by our colocated retail pharmacies our total CenterWell Pharmacy\u2122 market share can approach 60 The benefits of mailorder extend beyond our pharmacy operations leading to better medication adherence and health outcomes benefiting our members and health plan As an example MA members who utilize CenterWell Pharmacy demonstrate medication adherence rates ranging from 650 to 840 basis points higher than we see in traditional retail pharmacies for cholesterol blood pressure and diabetes treatments CenterWell Pharmacy Integrating our CenterWell assets As we look to the long term the growth and maturation of our CenterWell assets are expected to bolster our ability to continue to drive compelling earnings growth and increased cash flow creating additional capital deployment opportunities This time period will also allow for the maturation of the potential benefits from the advancement of the integration of our assets in local markets When we integrate our assets effectively in local markets we see accelerated volume growth better experiences and clinical outcomes and improved Humana Enterprise economics With a health plan member utilizing the full suite of CenterWell assets we can drive two to four times the direct margin dollars for the Enterprise versus one that utilizes the health plan alone In addition we believe successful integration of our assets can drive additional value in areas such as improved retention and higher Stars scores which we have not attempted to estimate in the two to four times metric We believe there is the potential to unlock significant value over time as our integration efforts mature and look forward to providing updates in the future Our pharmacy business will benefit from the significant growth in individual MA membership in 2023 as we anticipate maintaining our industryleading mailorder position further investing in the consumer experience and encouraging the continued use of mailorder despite comparable copays in the retail setting beginning in 2023 10 11 Environmental social and governance We\u2019re continuously working to ensure that our health plan products and services are as affordable as possible while also creating pathways for access to healthcare addressing social determinants of health SDOH and healthrelated social needs Thanks to processes such as integrated care delivery and using health screenings that consider SDOH and health literacy we have a clearer view of each member\u2019s very personal barriers to their best health Through use of our proprietary population health analytics capabilities we\u2019re able to aggregate and stratify more than 90 data sets to help us learn even more about the unique factors impacting a person\u2019s total health recognizing that helping them with their health often requires addressing environmental conditions and social and lifestyle factors housing education employment etc that prevent them from getting and staying well Building trust and taking care of people has always been core to our values and our company\u2019s purpose and mission As we meet people where they are and make things simpler for them we begin to establish trust which gives us the permission space to help them achieve their best health That\u2019s where real transformational change begins We know that our role in healthcare goes beyond being a good corporate citizen For us to have sustainable success as a company we need to not only have satisfied customers and associates but we must also contribute to society by tackling larger issues that stand in the way of healthy communities We are dedicated to improving the health of every person we serve demonstrated through our environmental social and governance ESG strategy\u2014to improve the health of each person each community the healthcare system and our environment\u2014 and it\u2019s our steadfast belief that everyone should have access to the resources and support they need to reach their full health potential 12 With over 60 years of healthcare experience our ability to impact the healthcare system has only grown We take this responsibility seriously by adopting bestpractice governance and business policies following rigorous quality and ethical standards working closely with healthcare providers and innovating on behalf of those we serve We understand that 60 of one\u2019s ability to lead a healthy meaningful life is shaped by environmental conditions and sociallifestyle factors We\u2019re leaning into that In our communities we support the dedicated people and organizations at the forefront of community health helping accelerate their reach and impact These collaborations move us towards the goals of eliminating social and structural barriers to health to achieve health equity Working closely with physicians clinicians community partners and national leaders we\u2019re able to \u201ctreat\u201d social needs and expand community capacity to address SDOH Many of these undertakings involve deep community collaborations such as establishing a process to screen patients for food insecurity in their doctor\u2019s office and immediately connect them to a local food bank for entitlement program enrollment and emergency food provision Measuring our progress and addressing opportunities is critical to achieving our strategy and creating value We know that\u2019s how we continue to build trust with all of our stakeholders and is why we are committed to transparent reporting on our ESG measures presenting both our progress and our shortcomings in our annual Impact Report We encourage you to read about our 2022 ESG initiatives and disclosures across five categories\u2014talent and diversity access to healthcare environmental impact data privacy and protection and product quality and safety\u2014 to

successful execution of our 1 billion valuecreation plan a return to abovemarket individual Medicare Advantage MA membership growth for 2023 and further advancement of our CenterWell\u2122 platform The strong earnings growth delivered in 2022 combined with the robust membership growth and financial outlook for 2023 increases our confidence in our midterm Adjusted earnings per share target of 37 in 2025 Strong industry fundamentals As an industry leader in seniorfocused integrated valuebased care delivering higherquality outcomes at a lower cost Humana is well positioned in the fastest growing segment in healthcare which will drive significant value in the mid and longterm Dear fellow stockholders This penetration rate is up 1200 basis points from 2018 to January 2023 and we expect high single digit growth rates for the MA industry through 20256 Medicare Advantage with its strong demographic growth and superior value proposition provides significant growth opportunity ahead Currently there are 594 million Medicareeligible individuals in the United States2 Thanks to strong demographic growth tailwinds this addressable market will continue to grow and by 2030 one in five US residents will reach retirement age3 When customers age into Medicare eligibility they have a choice to either enroll in an MA plan or the Original Medicare program We believe customers choose an MA product in large part because of the exceptional clinical outcomes and enhanced value proposition MA members have 43 fewer avoidable hospitalizations than Original Medicare and MA products provide 184 of additional benefits relative to Original Medicare on average nationally7 It is also noteworthy that MA plans meaningfully over index in supporting underserved populations with a majority of Hispanic Americans and nearly half of African Americans choosing an MA product8 In addition 39 of individuals eligible for Dual Eligible Special Needs Plan DSNP are enrolled in a DSNP plan as of January 2023 up from 22 at the end of 20189 2 Our ability to continue to provide better outcomes for our members and patients while also delivering compelling returns to our stockholders is underpinned by strong fundamentals in the MA industry and bolstered by Humana\u2019s differentiated capabilities and growing payer agnostic CenterWell platform along with our continued discipline in and focus on productivity and operating efficiencies KURT HILZINGER Chairman of the Board BRUCE BROUSSARD President and Chief Executive Officer 3 Humana\u2019s growth in MA has outpaced the industry historically with compounded annual growth CAGR of 104 between 2018 and 2022 while the industry grew at a rate of 97 over the same period10 In addition we expect growth of at least 5000 individual MA members for 2023 representing annual growth of 1  7  meaningfully outpacing industry growth This strong track record of aboveindustry growth is supported by our differentiated MA capabilities including our industryleading valuebased care portfolio our superior clinical quality solutions and our differentiated customercentric operations Humana\u2019s highly diversified valuebased care solutions and locally oriented provider relationship models set us apart from our competitors Humana\u2019s differentiated capabilities 104 1  7  Humana\u2019s expected individual MA membership growth in 2023 Humana\u2019s 2018 to 2022 MA Membership CAGR We support a wide range of valuebased models and customized solutions to support providers wherever they are in their journey of migrating to a valuebased clinical and operating model Our partnership model includes options such as partial or full risk alliance and joint venture models where we invest in growth together Humana has a robust people process and technology infrastructure to help providers succeed in valuebased care arrangements We continue to work to increase the penetration of valuebased primary care models given the improved quality and health outcomes these models consistently deliver Based on 2021 data members supported by valuebased providers experienced 9 fewer trips to the emergency room and overall 251000 fewer days in the hospital These models also deliver superior economic outcomes reducing total medical costs by an estimated 201 or 6 billion as compared to the same members had they been enrolled in Original Medicare11 The higher quality and lower costs associated with valuebased primary care creates a virtuous cycle allowing us to invest cost savings into additional benefits for our members driving greater plan satisfaction retention and growth at or above industry levels This is reflected in our plan designs where members associated with valuebased providers receive over 500 more in plan benefits on average annually These improved experiences and strong value proposition also result in higher relational Net Promoter Score\u00ae NPS\u00ae and retention We were proud to close 2022 with 70 of our individual MA members being supported by a valuebased provider who is incentivized to comprehensively and proactively manage patient needs leading to improved health outcomes and lower total cost of care 4 0 0 77 We have been recognized as leading the industry in member satisfaction and are proud that Humana has been named the Best Overall Medicare Advantage Insurance Company by US News and World Report which created an honor roll based on the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services\u2019 2023 Star Ratings for Medicare Advantage plans Additionally Humana was rated as the best company for member experience and best company for lowpremium plan availability In 2021 members supported by valuebased providers had an 8point higher NPS versus those supported by feeforservice providers while retention was 14 higher The provider also benefits from these models where physicians practicing under valuebased models earn 143 cents of every healthcare dollar compared to 64 cents for nonvaluebased physicians11 Our ability to maintain our leadership position in the MA industry is also supported by our excellence in quality and customer experiences Our success is demonstrated in areas such as Star Ratings where 96 of our MA members are enrolled in plans rated 4 stars and above for bonus year 202412 Humana has now achieved the highest percentage of members in 4plus Star contracts across all our national competitors for five consecutive years The success and capability leadership we\u2019ve experienced is enabled and sustained by consistent operational excellence and industryleading consumer experience 5 We remain the largest seniorfocused valuebased primary care platform in the United States closing 2022 with 235 centers a 14 yearoveryear increase Our centers which operate under the CenterWell and Conviva brands were staffed by 671 primary care providers serving over 191000 Medicare patients at the end of 2022 Humana MA members comprised approximately half of the de novo center panel while comprising over 70 of our whollyowned center panel Our valuebased primary care model focuses on personalized patient experience and health outcomes that will continue to reshape how care is provided to seniors The feeforservice system oriented to specialized episodic care is not well structured to meet the needs of an aging population with an increasing chronic disease prevalence where more than half of seniors have two or more chronic conditions and more than 30 of older Americans have social determinant barriers to health1314 This has contributed to critical challenges in senior care including rising costs and complexity poor outcomes and poor access to care CenterWell Senior Primary Care Valuebased primary care is uniquely positioned to solve these problems combining the trust and influence of the primary care physicianpatient relationship and a revenue model that rewards investment in proactive longitudinal care When compared to a feeforservice provider model our valuebased primary care model is oriented to smaller patient panels offers afterhours and same day appointments longer appointment times proactive preventative appointment scheduling and utilizes a multidisciplinary care team all of which is designed to drive improved quality and health outcomes United under the CenterWell brand we have significantly expanded our payer agnostic healthcare services capabilities including our seniorfocused primary care pharmacy and home care offerings We will continue to invest in our growing CenterWell assets and our ability to increase use of these capabilities by our health plan members while also increasing our total addressable market unlocking the potential to drive significant Enterprise earnings and margin growth And as we evolve and accelerate our strategy for continued leadership in an industry that is shifting rapidly toward valuebased care we expect that our CenterWell healthcare services will be an increasingly important contributor to our longterm growth Our Primary Care Organization continues to improve the operating performance in our whollyowned centers and we are pleased to report that we increased the number of centers that are contribution margin positive from 88 at the end of 2021 to 110 at yearend 2022 a 25 increase yearoveryear 6 In addition we increased the number of centers that have reached our 3 million contribution margin target from 18 in 2021 to 31 at the end of 2022 We have also demonstrated compelling member satisfaction with an NPS of 80 and favorable health outcomes with inpatient admits per thousand and emergency department visits per thousand running 43 and 72 lower than Original Medicare respectively151617 Our marketleading differentiated provider asset is well positioned for continued center expansion and patient panel growth and is expected to be a meaningful contributor to Enterprise earnings in the future Through accelerated de novo center expansion programmatic small and midsize merger and acquisition activity and improved organic growth in our whollyowned centers we anticipate expanding our number of centers by approximately 30 to 50 centers annually over the next several years and are targeting Medicare patient compounded annual growth of 18 to 20 Looking ahead we expect to have 400 to 450 centers serving approximately 450000 patients by 2025 18 With this growth we anticipate a contribution of approximately 100 million  200 million EBITDA from our Primary Care Organization in 2025 growing to more than 1 billion over the next 10 years 7 The strength of our core feeforservice home health business was evident in 2022 with total same store admissions up 63 yearoveryear compared to public peer growth of 07520 We have also grown the CenterWell Home Health\u2122 penetration rate of Humana home health episodes in markets where there is geographic overlap from 8 in 2017 when we entered into our initial transaction with Kindred at Home now CenterWell Home Health to 19 in 202221 We are confident we can significantly increase this volume in the years to come CenterWell Home Health We expect our home health admission growth to continue in the midsingle digits in 2023 as we look to offset the declining Original Medicare market with increased penetration of MA patients including Humana MA members In addition CenterWell Home Health is focused on increasing nursing capacity through recruiting and retention initiatives Our voluntary nursing turnover improved from 319 in 2021 to 306 in 2022 We continue to invest in clinical orientation and mentors as well as technology focused on reducing administrative tasks and drive time for clinicians\u2014which we expect to drive further improvement in nurse recruitment and retention Beyond growing our core feeforservice home business we are focused on providing members and patients with access to holistic valuebased care in the home that enhances the experience improves outcomes and reduces total cost of care Our valuebased home model which coordinates care and optimizes spend across home health durable medical equipment DME and infusion services is now supporting approximately 15 of our MA members\u2014up from 5 coverage in 2021 In addition we are implementing some of these capabilities on a standalone basis to accelerate value creation As of January 2023 we rolled out the home health utilization management and network management capabilities to 14 million additional members bringing the total number of covered members to 19 million creating incremental Enterprise value in advance of the full valuebased market rollout With approximately 6 market share19 CenterWell Home Health is the largest home health provider in the United States and we are well positioned to continue to grow our core home health business going forward 8 1 million additional members by year end 2023 Looking forward we expect to expand coverage of the full valuebased home model to approximately Today on average health plans in Humana markets with the greatest opportunity spend 35 to 40 per member per month on home health DME and infusion combined We believe the valuebased home health model can reduce these costs for the Enterprise by a net 10 to 15 thereby generating between 110 million to 150 million of incremental annual Enterprise value creation by 2025 800000 of which are currently served under the utilization and network management model and are on track to cover approximately 40 of our MA members with the full valuebased model by 2025 9 Our pharmacy dispensing business remains strong with industryleading mailorder penetration at 386 for our individual MA members in 2022 In addition in more mature CenterWell clinics we have seen mailorder penetration rates for Humana members approach 50 and when combined with prescriptions dispensed by our colocated retail pharmacies our total CenterWell Pharmacy\u2122 market share can approach 60 The benefits of mailorder extend beyond our pharmacy operations leading to better medication adherence and health outcomes benefiting our members and health plan As an example MA members who utilize CenterWell Pharmacy demonstrate medication adherence rates ranging from 650 to 840 basis points higher than we see in traditional retail pharmacies for cholesterol blood pressure and diabetes treatments CenterWell Pharmacy Integrating our CenterWell assets As we look to the long term the growth and maturation of our CenterWell assets are expected to bolster our ability to continue to drive compelling earnings growth and increased cash flow creating additional capital deployment opportunities This time period will also allow for the maturation of the potential benefits from the advancement of the integration of our assets in local markets When we integrate our assets effectively in local markets we see accelerated volume growth better experiences and clinical outcomes and improved Humana Enterprise economics With a health plan member utilizing the full suite of CenterWell assets we can drive two to four times the direct margin dollars for the Enterprise versus one that utilizes the health plan alone In addition we believe successful integration of our assets can drive additional value in areas such as improved retention and higher Stars scores which we have not attempted to estimate in the two to four times metric We believe there is the potential to unlock significant value over time as our integration efforts mature and look forward to providing updates in the future Our pharmacy business will benefit from the significant growth in individual MA membership in 2023 as we anticipate maintaining our industryleading mailorder position further investing in the consumer experience and encouraging the continued use of mailorder despite comparable copays in the retail setting beginning in 2023 10 11 Environmental social and governance We\u2019re continuously working to ensure that our health plan products and services are as affordable as possible while also creating pathways for access to healthcare addressing social determinants of health SDOH and healthrelated social needs Thanks to processes such as integrated care delivery and using health screenings that consider SDOH and health literacy we have a clearer view of each member\u2019s very personal barriers to their best health Through use of our proprietary population health analytics capabilities we\u2019re able to aggregate and stratify more than 90 data sets to help us learn even more about the unique factors impacting a person\u2019s total health recognizing that helping them with their health often requires addressing environmental conditions and social and lifestyle factors housing education employment etc that prevent them from getting and staying well Building trust and taking care of people has always been core to our values and our company\u2019s purpose and mission As we meet people where they are and make things simpler for them we begin to establish trust which gives us the permission space to help them achieve their best health That\u2019s where real transformational change begins We know that our role in healthcare goes beyond being a good corporate citizen For us to have sustainable success as a company we need to not only have satisfied customers and associates but we must also contribute to society by tackling larger issues that stand in the way of healthy communities We are dedicated to improving the health of every person we serve demonstrated through our environmental social and governance ESG strategy\u2014to improve the health of each person each community the healthcare system and our environment\u2014 and it\u2019s our steadfast belief that everyone should have access to the resources and support they need to reach their full health potential 12 With over 60 years of healthcare experience our ability to impact the healthcare system has only grown We take this responsibility seriously by adopting bestpractice governance and business policies following rigorous quality and ethical standards working closely with healthcare providers and innovating on behalf of those we serve We understand that 60 of one\u2019s ability to lead a healthy meaningful life is shaped by environmental conditions and sociallifestyle factors We\u2019re leaning into that In our communities we support the dedicated people and organizations at the forefront of community health helping accelerate their reach and impact These collaborations move us towards the goals of eliminating social and structural barriers to health to achieve health equity Working closely with physicians clinicians community partners and national leaders we\u2019re able to \u201ctreat\u201d social needs and expand community capacity to address SDOH Many of these undertakings involve deep community collaborations such as establishing a process to screen patients for food insecurity in their doctor\u2019s office and immediately connect them to a local food bank for entitlement program enrollment and emergency food provision Measuring our progress and addressing opportunities is critical to achieving our strategy and creating value We know that\u2019s how we continue to build trust with all of our stakeholders and is why we are committed to transparent reporting on our ESG measures presenting both our progress and our shortcomings in our annual Impact Report We encourage you to read about our 2022 ESG initiatives and disclosures across five categories\u2014talent and diversity access to healthcare environmental impact data privacy and protection and product quality and safety\u2014 to

We are helping to build a circular and inclusive value chain through actions designed to achieve NetZero emissions by 2040 become Net Water Positive by 2030 and help build a world where packaging never becomes waste As part of this we are adopting new models and decoupling environmental impact from business growth In 2022 we took important steps such as \u2022 Establishing a new global packaging goal for 20 of beverage servings to be delivered through reusable models by 2030 We intend to work toward this goal by expanding our SodaStream business building out our refillable offerings

more than\r\n13 billion in annual sales and roughly 5 billion in\r\naftertax profit\u2009\u2014\u2009executing our integrated strategies\r\nwith excellence\r\nThe progress we have made and our collective\r\ncommitment to our strategies give me confidence we\r\ncan manage through the challenges we will continue\r\nii \u2022 The Procter  Gamble Company\r\nto face Still we are cleareyed about the trials ahead\r\nThe operational cost and currency challenges we dealt\r\nwith over the last two years will continue in fiscal year\r\n2023 and we begin the new fiscal year with consumers\r\nfacing inflation levels not seen in the last 40 years\r\nThe best response to the uncertainties and\r\nchallenges\u2009\u2014\u2009double down on the integrated set of\r\nstrategies that are delivering very strong results\r\nWe are focused on delighting and serving consumers\r\ncustomers society and shareowners through five\r\nstrategic and integrated choices a portfolio of dailyuse products in categories where performance drives\r\nbrand choice superiority across product package\r\nbrand communication retail execution and value\r\nproductivity in everything we do constructive\r\ndisruption across the value chain and an agile\r\naccountable and empowered organization\r\nThese are not independent strategic choices They\r\nreinforce and build on each other and when executed\r\nwell they lead to balanced top and bottomline\r\ngrowth and value creation There is still meaningful\r\nopportunity for improvement and leverage in every\r\nfacet of this strategy and we continue to work to\r\nstrengthen our execution of these choices\r\nA Portfolio of Superior\r\nDailyUse Products\r\nPG has a focused portfolio of dailyuse products\r\n\u2009\u2014\u2009many providing cleaning health and hygiene\r\nbenefits\u2009\u2014\u2009in 10 categories where performance drives\r\nbrand choice Fabric Care Home Care Baby Care\r\nFeminine Care Family Care Hair Care Skin  Personal\r\nCare Oral Care Personal Health Care and Grooming\r\nWe know how to win in these categories\u2009\u2014\u2009by delivering\r\nirresistibly superior propositions to our consumers\r\nand retail partners across product performance\r\npackaging brand communication retail execution\r\nand value Continued investment in these five vectors\r\nof superiority is critical to drive sustainable business\r\ngrowth Even when our costs are rising sharply we\r\nwill not diverge from this strategy especially when\r\nconsumers are ever more focused on the performance\r\nand value of the brands they choose\r\nSuperiority to Win\r\nwith Consumers\r\nWe continue to raise the bar on all aspects of superiority\u2009\r\n \u2014\u2009product package brand communication retail\r\nexecution and value\u2009\u2014\u2009in all price tiers where we compete We are leveraging this superiority to grow markets\r\nand PG\u2019s share in them as a way to sustainably build\r\nthe business Creating new business is powerful with\r\nour retail partners as we work to jointly create value\r\nSuperiority is especially critical in an inflationary\r\nenvironment As consumers face increased pressure\r\non nearly every aspect of their household budgets\r\nwe invest to deliver truly superior value through a\r\ncombination of price and product performance to\r\nearn their loyalty every day We are committed to keep\r\ninvesting to strengthen the superiority of our brands\r\nacross innovation supply chains and brand equity to\r\ndeliver superior value for consumers\r\nOngoing Productivity\r\nThe strategic need for investment to strengthen the\r\nlongterm health and competitiveness of our brands\r\nthe shortterm need to manage through significant\r\ncost increases and the ongoing need to drive balanced\r\ntop and bottomline growth including margin\r\nexpansion underscore the importance of productivity\r\nWe have developed a strong productivity muscle\r\nover the last decade as we delivered two 10 billion\r\nsavings programs Productivity is part of our DNA\r\nnow which will help us address some of the challenges\r\nwe face We remain fully committed to cost and cash\r\nproductivity in all facets of our business No area of cost\r\nis left untouched\r\nFor example as COVID19 supply chain challenges ease\r\nand we reach a better balance of supply and demand\r\nwe will have an increased opportunity to implement\r\ncost savings projects in our manufacturing operations\r\nAs we leverage digital tools and automation there\r\nwill be more opportunities to focus employees on the\r\nhigherorder work of serving consumers And as we\r\ncontinue to integrate data and analytics and artificial\r\nintelligence brand teams will be working to make\r\nour marketing investments even more efficient and\r\neffective to deliver improved demand creation at equal\r\nor lower cost\r\nEach business is driving productivity up and down\r\ntheir income statement and across their balance sheet\r\nand we remain fully committed to productivity as a\r\ncore driver of balanced top and bottomline growth\r\nand strong cash generation We cannot let up here\r\nProductivity will remain a significant part of our work\r\nespecially now A Constructive\r\nDisruption Mindset\r\nSuccess in our highly competitive industry\r\nalso requires agility that comes with a mindset\r\nof constructive disruption\u2009\u2014\u2009a willingness to\r\nchange adapt and create new trends and\r\ntechnologies that will shape our industry\r\nfor the future A mindset of constructive\r\ndisruption is even more important in this\r\nchallenging environment\r\nA good example of constructive disruption\r\nin a category is Dawn Powerwash Dish\r\nSpray which addresses the changing habit of\r\nwashing dishes as you go instead of waiting\r\nuntil the end of a meal The product enables\r\ndirect application of activated suds to dishes\r\nto speed up the entire process saving people\r\nnot only time but also water\r\nAnother example is how we continue to\r\nreinvent brand building including how\r\nwe reach consumers more effectively and\r\nefficiently Pampers our largest and most\r\nglobal brand is relatively unique in that\r\nits primary audience is narrow parents of\r\nchildren at diapering age To reach these\r\nparents more precisely Pampers created the\r\nPampers Rewards app so parents can receive\r\nhelpful information tips deals and rewards\r\nWith this app Pampers was able to build\r\nsmart audiences to reach parents at different\r\nstages\u2009\u2014\u2009like newborns crawling and potty\r\ntraining\u2009\u2014\u2009with more precise advertising\r\nspecifically designed for each media platform\r\nincreasing the brand\u2019s reach effectiveness\r\nand efficiency while driving cost savings\r\nSuccess in our highly competitive industry\r\nrequires the agility that comes with a\r\nmindset of constructive disruption\u2009\u2014\u2009An Empowered Agile and\r\nAccountable Organization\r\nWe strive for an empowered agile and accountable\r\norganization with little overlap or redundancy\u2009\u2014\u2009\r\nflowing to new demands and seamlessly supporting\r\neach other through a culture of equality and inclusion\r\nto deliver against our priorities around the world\r\nPG is organized around five industrybased\r\nsector business units SBUs These five sectors\r\nmanage our 10 product categories with full sales\r\nprofit cash and value creation responsibility for our\r\nlargest and most profitable markets\u2009\u2014\u2009called Focus\r\nMarkets\u2009\u2014\u2009accounting for about 80 of Company\r\nsales and about 90 of aftertax profit\r\nEnterprise Markets which represent the rest of the\r\nworld are a separate unit with sales profit and value\r\ncreation responsibility Over the last several years\r\nwe have been growing both top and bottom line in\r\nnearly all of these markets which are important to\r\nthe future of PG\r\nThe best proof that this organization design is working\r\nis the growth of our largest and most profitable market\r\nNorth America whose growth has accelerated since\r\nwe put this design in place Organic sales in North\r\nAmerica have increased from an average of 2 the\r\nthree years prior to the design change to 8 in the\r\nthree years since\r\nThis structure and its resulting organizational speed\r\nand focus has also allowed us to manage through\r\nthe challenges and headwinds we are experiencing\r\nWe continue to believe that this structure\u2009\u2014\u2009with the\r\nSBUs squarely concentrated on Focus Markets and\r\nmanaging Enterprise Markets as a separate operating\r\nunit\u2009\u2014\u2009is the best way to navigate successfully through\r\nthe increasingly dynamic world in which we live\r\nOperating through five industrybased Sector Business Units\r\nProviding greater clarity on\r\nresponsibilities and reporting lines\r\nStrengthening leadership\r\naccountability\r\nEnabling PG people to accelerate\r\ngrowth and value creation\r\nStrengthening Our Strategy\r\nOne of the most important things about our strategy\u2009\r\n \u2014\u2009portfolio superiority productivity constructive\r\ndisruption and an empowered agile and accountable\r\norganization\u2009\u2014\u2009is that it is inherently dynamic not static\r\nIt requires being responsive to changing consumer\r\nneeds and habits It demands we serve evolving\r\ncustomer needs in rapidly transforming channels\r\nGoing forward we have identified four areas to be\r\neven more deliberate and intentional about pursuing\r\nto further strengthen the execution of our strategy\r\nThe first is Supply We are improving our supply chain\r\ncapacity agility cost efficiency and resilience for a new\r\nreality and a new age The capability investments we\r\nmade prior to COVID19 to improve our manufacturing\r\nand distribution networks in the US and Europe\r\nhelped us to manage through the last few years with\r\nrelatively few prolonged issues We are already making\r\nthe next round of investments needed to ensure\r\nwe have multiple qualified suppliers for key inputs\r\nsufficient manufacturing capacity to satisfy growing\r\ndemand and flexibility to meet the changing needs\r\nof all types of retailers\r\nThe second area is Environmental Sustainability\r\nWe are integrating sustainability into our product\r\npackaging and supply chain innovation work to develop\r\nirresistibly superior offerings for consumers that are\r\nbetter for the environment For example our new\r\ncardboard packaging on Gillette razors reduces plastic\r\npackaging and offers a noticeably superior experience\r\nfor consumers at the first and second moments of\r\ntruth Another example is our new fully recyclable\r\npaper packaging on our premium Always Cotton\r\nProtection pads recently launched in Germany One\r\nmore example is coldwater washing with Tide and\r\nAriel When people turn their wash cycles to cold they\r\ncan save up to 90 of the energy used on every load\r\nof laundry while saving money They also get greater\r\nsatisfaction because their colors look brighter and their\r\nclothes look newer longer Better for the consumer\r\nbetter for our planet\r\nThird we are increasing our Digital Acumen to drive\r\nconsumer and customer preference reduce cost and\r\nenable rapid and efficient decision making Increased\r\nThe Procter  Gamble Company \u2022 vii\r\ndigitization of our manufacturing lines more use\r\nof artificial intelligence and more use of blockchain\r\ntechnology are not ends unto themselves They are\r\ntools we can use to delight consumers and customers\r\nFourth a Superior Employee Value Equation for all\r\ngender identities races ethnicities sexual orientations\r\nages and abilities\u2009\u2014\u2009for all roles\u2009\u2014\u2009to ensure we\r\ncontinue to attract retain and develop the best talent\r\nBy definition this must include equality To deliver\r\na superior employee value equation there must be\r\nsomething in it for everyone\r\nThese are not new or separate strategies They are\r\nnecessary elements of focus in continuing to build\r\nsuperiority in reducing cost to enable investment and\r\nvalue creation and in strengthening our organization\r\nThey are part of the constructive disruption we must\r\ncontinue to lead\r\nMeeting Consumer Customer\r\nEmployee Societal and\r\nInvestor Needs\r\nIn the ever more complex world we live in it is not\r\njust top and bottom line that must be delivered\r\nand balanced We must endeavor to deliver against\r\nthe needs of an increasing number of constituents\r\nThis is especially true in our efforts in Environmental\r\nSocial and Governance ESG where consumer\r\ncustomer employee society and shareowner\r\nexpectations are growing As I shared earlier our consumers increasingly rely on\r\nus to deliver superior solutions that are sustainable\r\nOur world requires that we do our part in this regard\r\nThis challenge is also an opportunity to extend our\r\nmargin of superiority further grow categories and\r\ncreate more value all while improving our own\r\nenvironmental impact enabling consumers to\r\nreduce their footprint and helping society solve\r\nsome of the most pressing global challenges Our Community Impact work helps improve lives\r\nfor people in difficult times by providing clean water\r\nand donations of product time and money to those\r\naffected by natural disasters and crises around the\r\nworld It is also part of what employees are proud\r\nof and value in PG The ability to do good for the\r\ncommunities we live and work in also helps us\r\nattract and retain the best talent\r\nWe know we increase our chances of winning when\r\nwe have an equal diverse and inclusive culture that\r\ngives life to the best thoughts and ideas\u2009\u2014\u2009a culture\r\nwhere everyone can succeed and is able to be their best\r\nExternally we support equality and inclusion efforts\r\nwith our business partners and in the communities\r\nwhere we live and work because it is not only the right\r\nthing to do but it also can improve income and wealth\r\nequity for more people creating more purchasing\r\npower which drives market growth\r\nOur foundation is our Purpose Values and Principles\r\nwhich set a high standard for each PG person High\r\nstandards are good They require that we hold ourselves\r\nand each other accountable for results and equally\r\nimportant for how we achieve those results Last\r\nyear we added an ESG factor to our annual incentive\r\ncompensation program for our senior executives as\r\na demonstration of our commitment to nearterm\r\nprogress toward our longterm ESG goals\r\nServing and balancing the needs of consumers\r\ncustomers employees society and shareowners\r\nwill not be easy but it is necessary\u2009\u2014\u2009and those\r\nthat do it best as I expect we will should thrive Looking Forward\r\nThe integrated strategies we have outlined here\r\nwere delivering strong results before the pandemic\r\nThey served us well during the more recent volatile\r\ntimes They remain the right strategic choices to drive\r\nbalanced growth and value creation We endeavor\r\nto step forward into the challenges we face not back\r\ngrowing through nearterm challenges while serving\r\nconsumers and communities We are doing this in\r\nour interest in society\u2019s interest and in the interest\r\nof our longterm shareowners\r\nConfidence in our future success is rooted in my\r\nconfidence in PG people Every day PG people\r\ndemonstrate their commitment to our Purpose\r\nValues and

more than\r\n13 billion in annual sales and roughly 5 billion in\r\naftertax profit\u2009\u2014\u2009executing our integrated strategies\r\nwith excellence\r\nThe progress we have made and our collective\r\ncommitment to our strategies give me confidence we\r\ncan manage through the challenges we will continue\r\nii \u2022 The Procter  Gamble Company\r\nto face Still we are cleareyed about the trials ahead\r\nThe operational cost and currency challenges we dealt\r\nwith over the last two years will continue in fiscal year\r\n2023 and we begin the new fiscal year with consumers\r\nfacing inflation levels not seen in the last 40 years\r\nThe best response to the uncertainties and\r\nchallenges\u2009\u2014\u2009double down on the integrated set of\r\nstrategies that are delivering very strong results\r\nWe are focused on delighting and serving consumers\r\ncustomers society and shareowners through five\r\nstrategic and integrated choices a portfolio of dailyuse products in categories where performance drives\r\nbrand choice superiority across product package\r\nbrand communication retail execution and value\r\nproductivity in everything we do constructive\r\ndisruption across the value chain and an agile\r\naccountable and empowered organization\r\nThese are not independent strategic choices They\r\nreinforce and build on each other and when executed\r\nwell they lead to balanced top and bottomline\r\ngrowth and value creation There is still meaningful\r\nopportunity for improvement and leverage in every\r\nfacet of this strategy and we continue to work to\r\nstrengthen our execution of these choices\r\nA Portfolio of Superior\r\nDailyUse Products\r\nPG has a focused portfolio of dailyuse products\r\n\u2009\u2014\u2009many providing cleaning health and hygiene\r\nbenefits\u2009\u2014\u2009in 10 categories where performance drives\r\nbrand choice Fabric Care Home Care Baby Care\r\nFeminine Care Family Care Hair Care Skin  Personal\r\nCare Oral Care Personal Health Care and Grooming\r\nWe know how to win in these categories\u2009\u2014\u2009by delivering\r\nirresistibly superior propositions to our consumers\r\nand retail partners across product performance\r\npackaging brand communication retail execution\r\nand value Continued investment in these five vectors\r\nof superiority is critical to drive sustainable business\r\ngrowth Even when our costs are rising sharply we\r\nwill not diverge from this strategy especially when\r\nconsumers are ever more focused on the performance\r\nand value of the brands they choose\r\nSuperiority to Win\r\nwith Consumers\r\nWe continue to raise the bar on all aspects of superiority\u2009\r\n \u2014\u2009product package brand communication retail\r\nexecution and value\u2009\u2014\u2009in all price tiers where we compete We are leveraging this superiority to grow markets\r\nand PG\u2019s share in them as a way to sustainably build\r\nthe business Creating new business is powerful with\r\nour retail partners as we work to jointly create value\r\nSuperiority is especially critical in an inflationary\r\nenvironment As consumers face increased pressure\r\non nearly every aspect of their household budgets\r\nwe invest to deliver truly superior value through a\r\ncombination of price and product performance to\r\nearn their loyalty every day We are committed to keep\r\ninvesting to strengthen the superiority of our brands\r\nacross innovation supply chains and brand equity to\r\ndeliver superior value for consumers\r\nOngoing Productivity\r\nThe strategic need for investment to strengthen the\r\nlongterm health and competitiveness of our brands\r\nthe shortterm need to manage through significant\r\ncost increases and the ongoing need to drive balanced\r\ntop and bottomline growth including margin\r\nexpansion underscore the importance of productivity\r\nWe have developed a strong productivity muscle\r\nover the last decade as we delivered two 10 billion\r\nsavings programs Productivity is part of our DNA\r\nnow which will help us address some of the challenges\r\nwe face We remain fully committed to cost and cash\r\nproductivity in all facets of our business No area of cost\r\nis left untouched\r\nFor example as COVID19 supply chain challenges ease\r\nand we reach a better balance of supply and demand\r\nwe will have an increased opportunity to implement\r\ncost savings projects in our manufacturing operations\r\nAs we leverage digital tools and automation there\r\nwill be more opportunities to focus employees on the\r\nhigherorder work of serving consumers And as we\r\ncontinue to integrate data and analytics and artificial\r\nintelligence brand teams will be working to make\r\nour marketing investments even more efficient and\r\neffective to deliver improved demand creation at equal\r\nor lower cost\r\nEach business is driving productivity up and down\r\ntheir income statement and across their balance sheet\r\nand we remain fully committed to productivity as a\r\ncore driver of balanced top and bottomline growth\r\nand strong cash generation We cannot let up here\r\nProductivity will remain a significant part of our work\r\nespecially now A Constructive\r\nDisruption Mindset\r\nSuccess in our highly competitive industry\r\nalso requires agility that comes with a mindset\r\nof constructive disruption\u2009\u2014\u2009a willingness to\r\nchange adapt and create new trends and\r\ntechnologies that will shape our industry\r\nfor the future A mindset of constructive\r\ndisruption is even more important in this\r\nchallenging environment\r\nA good example of constructive disruption\r\nin a category is Dawn Powerwash Dish\r\nSpray which addresses the changing habit of\r\nwashing dishes as you go instead of waiting\r\nuntil the end of a meal The product enables\r\ndirect application of activated suds to dishes\r\nto speed up the entire process saving people\r\nnot only time but also water\r\nAnother example is how we continue to\r\nreinvent brand building including how\r\nwe reach consumers more effectively and\r\nefficiently Pampers our largest and most\r\nglobal brand is relatively unique in that\r\nits primary audience is narrow parents of\r\nchildren at diapering age To reach these\r\nparents more precisely Pampers created the\r\nPampers Rewards app so parents can receive\r\nhelpful information tips deals and rewards\r\nWith this app Pampers was able to build\r\nsmart audiences to reach parents at different\r\nstages\u2009\u2014\u2009like newborns crawling and potty\r\ntraining\u2009\u2014\u2009with more precise advertising\r\nspecifically designed for each media platform\r\nincreasing the brand\u2019s reach effectiveness\r\nand efficiency while driving cost savings\r\nSuccess in our highly competitive industry\r\nrequires the agility that comes with a\r\nmindset of constructive disruption\u2009\u2014\u2009An Empowered Agile and\r\nAccountable Organization\r\nWe strive for an empowered agile and accountable\r\norganization with little overlap or redundancy\u2009\u2014\u2009\r\nflowing to new demands and seamlessly supporting\r\neach other through a culture of equality and inclusion\r\nto deliver against our priorities around the world\r\nPG is organized around five industrybased\r\nsector business units SBUs These five sectors\r\nmanage our 10 product categories with full sales\r\nprofit cash and value creation responsibility for our\r\nlargest and most profitable markets\u2009\u2014\u2009called Focus\r\nMarkets\u2009\u2014\u2009accounting for about 80 of Company\r\nsales and about 90 of aftertax profit\r\nEnterprise Markets which represent the rest of the\r\nworld are a separate unit with sales profit and value\r\ncreation responsibility Over the last several years\r\nwe have been growing both top and bottom line in\r\nnearly all of these markets which are important to\r\nthe future of PG\r\nThe best proof that this organization design is working\r\nis the growth of our largest and most profitable market\r\nNorth America whose growth has accelerated since\r\nwe put this design in place Organic sales in North\r\nAmerica have increased from an average of 2 the\r\nthree years prior to the design change to 8 in the\r\nthree years since\r\nThis structure and its resulting organizational speed\r\nand focus has also allowed us to manage through\r\nthe challenges and headwinds we are experiencing\r\nWe continue to believe that this structure\u2009\u2014\u2009with the\r\nSBUs squarely concentrated on Focus Markets and\r\nmanaging Enterprise Markets as a separate operating\r\nunit\u2009\u2014\u2009is the best way to navigate successfully through\r\nthe increasingly dynamic world in which we live\r\nOperating through five industrybased Sector Business Units\r\nProviding greater clarity on\r\nresponsibilities and reporting lines\r\nStrengthening leadership\r\naccountability\r\nEnabling PG people to accelerate\r\ngrowth and value creation\r\nStrengthening Our Strategy\r\nOne of the most important things about our strategy\u2009\r\n \u2014\u2009portfolio superiority productivity constructive\r\ndisruption and an empowered agile and accountable\r\norganization\u2009\u2014\u2009is that it is inherently dynamic not static\r\nIt requires being responsive to changing consumer\r\nneeds and habits It demands we serve evolving\r\ncustomer needs in rapidly transforming channels\r\nGoing forward we have identified four areas to be\r\neven more deliberate and intentional about pursuing\r\nto further strengthen the execution of our strategy\r\nThe first is Supply We are improving our supply chain\r\ncapacity agility cost efficiency and resilience for a new\r\nreality and a new age The capability investments we\r\nmade prior to COVID19 to improve our manufacturing\r\nand distribution networks in the US and Europe\r\nhelped us to manage through the last few years with\r\nrelatively few prolonged issues We are already making\r\nthe next round of investments needed to ensure\r\nwe have multiple qualified suppliers for key inputs\r\nsufficient manufacturing capacity to satisfy growing\r\ndemand and flexibility to meet the changing needs\r\nof all types of retailers\r\nThe second area is Environmental Sustainability\r\nWe are integrating sustainability into our product\r\npackaging and supply chain innovation work to develop\r\nirresistibly superior offerings for consumers that are\r\nbetter for the environment For example our new\r\ncardboard packaging on Gillette razors reduces plastic\r\npackaging and offers a noticeably superior experience\r\nfor consumers at the first and second moments of\r\ntruth Another example is our new fully recyclable\r\npaper packaging on our premium Always Cotton\r\nProtection pads recently launched in Germany One\r\nmore example is coldwater washing with Tide and\r\nAriel When people turn their wash cycles to cold they\r\ncan save up to 90 of the energy used on every load\r\nof laundry while saving money They also get greater\r\nsatisfaction because their colors look brighter and their\r\nclothes look newer longer Better for the consumer\r\nbetter for our planet\r\nThird we are increasing our Digital Acumen to drive\r\nconsumer and customer preference reduce cost and\r\nenable rapid and efficient decision making Increased\r\nThe Procter  Gamble Company \u2022 vii\r\ndigitization of our manufacturing lines more use\r\nof artificial intelligence and more use of blockchain\r\ntechnology are not ends unto themselves They are\r\ntools we can use to delight consumers and customers\r\nFourth a Superior Employee Value Equation for all\r\ngender identities races ethnicities sexual orientations\r\nages and abilities\u2009\u2014\u2009for all roles\u2009\u2014\u2009to ensure we\r\ncontinue to attract retain and develop the best talent\r\nBy definition this must include equality To deliver\r\na superior employee value equation there must be\r\nsomething in it for everyone\r\nThese are not new or separate strategies They are\r\nnecessary elements of focus in continuing to build\r\nsuperiority in reducing cost to enable investment and\r\nvalue creation and in strengthening our organization\r\nThey are part of the constructive disruption we must\r\ncontinue to lead\r\nMeeting Consumer Customer\r\nEmployee Societal and\r\nInvestor Needs\r\nIn the ever more complex world we live in it is not\r\njust top and bottom line that must be delivered\r\nand balanced We must endeavor to deliver against\r\nthe needs of an increasing number of constituents\r\nThis is especially true in our efforts in Environmental\r\nSocial and Governance ESG where consumer\r\ncustomer employee society and shareowner\r\nexpectations are growing As I shared earlier our consumers increasingly rely on\r\nus to deliver superior solutions that are sustainable\r\nOur world requires that we do our part in this regard\r\nThis challenge is also an opportunity to extend our\r\nmargin of superiority further grow categories and\r\ncreate more value all while improving our own\r\nenvironmental impact enabling consumers to\r\nreduce their footprint and helping society solve\r\nsome of the most pressing global challenges Our Community Impact work helps improve lives\r\nfor people in difficult times by providing clean water\r\nand donations of product time and money to those\r\naffected by natural disasters and crises around the\r\nworld It is also part of what employees are proud\r\nof and value in PG The ability to do good for the\r\ncommunities we live and work in also helps us\r\nattract and retain the best talent\r\nWe know we increase our chances of winning when\r\nwe have an equal diverse and inclusive culture that\r\ngives life to the best thoughts and ideas\u2009\u2014\u2009a culture\r\nwhere everyone can succeed and is able to be their best\r\nExternally we support equality and inclusion efforts\r\nwith our business partners and in the communities\r\nwhere we live and work because it is not only the right\r\nthing to do but it also can improve income and wealth\r\nequity for more people creating more purchasing\r\npower which drives market growth\r\nOur foundation is our Purpose Values and Principles\r\nwhich set a high standard for each PG person High\r\nstandards are good They require that we hold ourselves\r\nand each other accountable for results and equally\r\nimportant for how we achieve those results Last\r\nyear we added an ESG factor to our annual incentive\r\ncompensation program for our senior executives as\r\na demonstration of our commitment to nearterm\r\nprogress toward our longterm ESG goals\r\nServing and balancing the needs of consumers\r\ncustomers employees society and shareowners\r\nwill not be easy but it is necessary\u2009\u2014\u2009and those\r\nthat do it best as I expect we will should thrive Looking Forward\r\nThe integrated strategies we have outlined here\r\nwere delivering strong results before the pandemic\r\nThey served us well during the more recent volatile\r\ntimes They remain the right strategic choices to drive\r\nbalanced growth and value creation We endeavor\r\nto step forward into the challenges we face not back\r\ngrowing through nearterm challenges while serving\r\nconsumers and communities We are doing this in\r\nour interest in society\u2019s interest and in the interest\r\nof our longterm shareowners\r\nConfidence in our future success is rooted in my\r\nconfidence in PG people Every day PG people\r\ndemonstrate their commitment to our Purpose\r\nValues and

more than\r\n13 billion in annual sales and roughly 5 billion in\r\naftertax profit\u2009\u2014\u2009executing our integrated strategies\r\nwith excellence\r\nThe progress we have made and our collective\r\ncommitment to our strategies give me confidence we\r\ncan manage through the challenges we will continue\r\nii \u2022 The Procter  Gamble Company\r\nto face Still we are cleareyed about the trials ahead\r\nThe operational cost and currency challenges we dealt\r\nwith over the last two years will continue in fiscal year\r\n2023 and we begin the new fiscal year with consumers\r\nfacing inflation levels not seen in the last 40 years\r\nThe best response to the uncertainties and\r\nchallenges\u2009\u2014\u2009double down on the integrated set of\r\nstrategies that are delivering very strong results\r\nWe are focused on delighting and serving consumers\r\ncustomers society and shareowners through five\r\nstrategic and integrated choices a portfolio of dailyuse products in categories where performance drives\r\nbrand choice superiority across product package\r\nbrand communication retail execution and value\r\nproductivity in everything we do constructive\r\ndisruption across the value chain and an agile\r\naccountable and empowered organization\r\nThese are not independent strategic choices They\r\nreinforce and build on each other and when executed\r\nwell they lead to balanced top and bottomline\r\ngrowth and value creation There is still meaningful\r\nopportunity for improvement and leverage in every\r\nfacet of this strategy and we continue to work to\r\nstrengthen our execution of these choices\r\nA Portfolio of Superior\r\nDailyUse Products\r\nPG has a focused portfolio of dailyuse products\r\n\u2009\u2014\u2009many providing cleaning health and hygiene\r\nbenefits\u2009\u2014\u2009in 10 categories where performance drives\r\nbrand choice Fabric Care Home Care Baby Care\r\nFeminine Care Family Care Hair Care Skin  Personal\r\nCare Oral Care Personal Health Care and Grooming\r\nWe know how to win in these categories\u2009\u2014\u2009by delivering\r\nirresistibly superior propositions to our consumers\r\nand retail partners across product performance\r\npackaging brand communication retail execution\r\nand value Continued investment in these five vectors\r\nof superiority is critical to drive sustainable business\r\ngrowth Even when our costs are rising sharply we\r\nwill not diverge from this strategy especially when\r\nconsumers are ever more focused on the performance\r\nand value of the brands they choose\r\nSuperiority to Win\r\nwith Consumers\r\nWe continue to raise the bar on all aspects of superiority\u2009\r\n \u2014\u2009product package brand communication retail\r\nexecution and value\u2009\u2014\u2009in all price tiers where we compete We are leveraging this superiority to grow markets\r\nand PG\u2019s share in them as a way to sustainably build\r\nthe business Creating new business is powerful with\r\nour retail partners as we work to jointly create value\r\nSuperiority is especially critical in an inflationary\r\nenvironment As consumers face increased pressure\r\non nearly every aspect of their household budgets\r\nwe invest to deliver truly superior value through a\r\ncombination of price and product performance to\r\nearn their loyalty every day We are committed to keep\r\ninvesting to strengthen the superiority of our brands\r\nacross innovation supply chains and brand equity to\r\ndeliver superior value for consumers\r\nOngoing Productivity\r\nThe strategic need for investment to strengthen the\r\nlongterm health and competitiveness of our brands\r\nthe shortterm need to manage through significant\r\ncost increases and the ongoing need to drive balanced\r\ntop and bottomline growth including margin\r\nexpansion underscore the importance of productivity\r\nWe have developed a strong productivity muscle\r\nover the last decade as we delivered two 10 billion\r\nsavings programs Productivity is part of our DNA\r\nnow which will help us address some of the challenges\r\nwe face We remain fully committed to cost and cash\r\nproductivity in all facets of our business No area of cost\r\nis left untouched\r\nFor example as COVID19 supply chain challenges ease\r\nand we reach a better balance of supply and demand\r\nwe will have an increased opportunity to implement\r\ncost savings projects in our manufacturing operations\r\nAs we leverage digital tools and automation there\r\nwill be more opportunities to focus employees on the\r\nhigherorder work of serving consumers And as we\r\ncontinue to integrate data and analytics and artificial\r\nintelligence brand teams will be working to make\r\nour marketing investments even more efficient and\r\neffective to deliver improved demand creation at equal\r\nor lower cost\r\nEach business is driving productivity up and down\r\ntheir income statement and across their balance sheet\r\nand we remain fully committed to productivity as a\r\ncore driver of balanced top and bottomline growth\r\nand strong cash generation We cannot let up here\r\nProductivity will remain a significant part of our work\r\nespecially now A Constructive\r\nDisruption Mindset\r\nSuccess in our highly competitive industry\r\nalso requires agility that comes with a mindset\r\nof constructive disruption\u2009\u2014\u2009a willingness to\r\nchange adapt and create new trends and\r\ntechnologies that will shape our industry\r\nfor the future A mindset of constructive\r\ndisruption is even more important in this\r\nchallenging environment\r\nA good example of constructive disruption\r\nin a category is Dawn Powerwash Dish\r\nSpray which addresses the changing habit of\r\nwashing dishes as you go instead of waiting\r\nuntil the end of a meal The product enables\r\ndirect application of activated suds to dishes\r\nto speed up the entire process saving people\r\nnot only time but also water\r\nAnother example is how we continue to\r\nreinvent brand building including how\r\nwe reach consumers more effectively and\r\nefficiently Pampers our largest and most\r\nglobal brand is relatively unique in that\r\nits primary audience is narrow parents of\r\nchildren at diapering age To reach these\r\nparents more precisely Pampers created the\r\nPampers Rewards app so parents can receive\r\nhelpful information tips deals and rewards\r\nWith this app Pampers was able to build\r\nsmart audiences to reach parents at different\r\nstages\u2009\u2014\u2009like newborns crawling and potty\r\ntraining\u2009\u2014\u2009with more precise advertising\r\nspecifically designed for each media platform\r\nincreasing the brand\u2019s reach effectiveness\r\nand efficiency while driving cost savings\r\nSuccess in our highly competitive industry\r\nrequires the agility that comes with a\r\nmindset of constructive disruption\u2009\u2014\u2009An Empowered Agile and\r\nAccountable Organization\r\nWe strive for an empowered agile and accountable\r\norganization with little overlap or redundancy\u2009\u2014\u2009\r\nflowing to new demands and seamlessly supporting\r\neach other through a culture of equality and inclusion\r\nto deliver against our priorities around the world\r\nPG is organized around five industrybased\r\nsector business units SBUs These five sectors\r\nmanage our 10 product categories with full sales\r\nprofit cash and value creation responsibility for our\r\nlargest and most profitable markets\u2009\u2014\u2009called Focus\r\nMarkets\u2009\u2014\u2009accounting for about 80 of Company\r\nsales and about 90 of aftertax profit\r\nEnterprise Markets which represent the rest of the\r\nworld are a separate unit with sales profit and value\r\ncreation responsibility Over the last several years\r\nwe have been growing both top and bottom line in\r\nnearly all of these markets which are important to\r\nthe future of PG\r\nThe best proof that this organization design is working\r\nis the growth of our largest and most profitable market\r\nNorth America whose growth has accelerated since\r\nwe put this design in place Organic sales in North\r\nAmerica have increased from an average of 2 the\r\nthree years prior to the design change to 8 in the\r\nthree years since\r\nThis structure and its resulting organizational speed\r\nand focus has also allowed us to manage through\r\nthe challenges and headwinds we are experiencing\r\nWe continue to believe that this structure\u2009\u2014\u2009with the\r\nSBUs squarely concentrated on Focus Markets and\r\nmanaging Enterprise Markets as a separate operating\r\nunit\u2009\u2014\u2009is the best way to navigate successfully through\r\nthe increasingly dynamic world in which we live\r\nOperating through five industrybased Sector Business Units\r\nProviding greater clarity on\r\nresponsibilities and reporting lines\r\nStrengthening leadership\r\naccountability\r\nEnabling PG people to accelerate\r\ngrowth and value creation\r\nStrengthening Our Strategy\r\nOne of the most important things about our strategy\u2009\r\n \u2014\u2009portfolio superiority productivity constructive\r\ndisruption and an empowered agile and accountable\r\norganization\u2009\u2014\u2009is that it is inherently dynamic not static\r\nIt requires being responsive to changing consumer\r\nneeds and habits It demands we serve evolving\r\ncustomer needs in rapidly transforming channels\r\nGoing forward we have identified four areas to be\r\neven more deliberate and intentional about pursuing\r\nto further strengthen the execution of our strategy\r\nThe first is Supply We are improving our supply chain\r\ncapacity agility cost efficiency and resilience for a new\r\nreality and a new age The capability investments we\r\nmade prior to COVID19 to improve our manufacturing\r\nand distribution networks in the US and Europe\r\nhelped us to manage through the last few years with\r\nrelatively few prolonged issues We are already making\r\nthe next round of investments needed to ensure\r\nwe have multiple qualified suppliers for key inputs\r\nsufficient manufacturing capacity to satisfy growing\r\ndemand and flexibility to meet the changing needs\r\nof all types of retailers\r\nThe second area is Environmental Sustainability\r\nWe are integrating sustainability into our product\r\npackaging and supply chain innovation work to develop\r\nirresistibly superior offerings for consumers that are\r\nbetter for the environment For example our new\r\ncardboard packaging on Gillette razors reduces plastic\r\npackaging and offers a noticeably superior experience\r\nfor consumers at the first and second moments of\r\ntruth Another example is our new fully recyclable\r\npaper packaging on our premium Always Cotton\r\nProtection pads recently launched in Germany One\r\nmore example is coldwater washing with Tide and\r\nAriel When people turn their wash cycles to cold they\r\ncan save up to 90 of the energy used on every load\r\nof laundry while saving money They also get greater\r\nsatisfaction because their colors look brighter and their\r\nclothes look newer longer Better for the consumer\r\nbetter for our planet\r\nThird we are increasing our Digital Acumen to drive\r\nconsumer and customer preference reduce cost and\r\nenable rapid and efficient decision making Increased\r\nThe Procter  Gamble Company \u2022 vii\r\ndigitization of our manufacturing lines more use\r\nof artificial intelligence and more use of blockchain\r\ntechnology are not ends unto themselves They are\r\ntools we can use to delight consumers and customers\r\nFourth a Superior Employee Value Equation for all\r\ngender identities races ethnicities sexual orientations\r\nages and abilities\u2009\u2014\u2009for all roles\u2009\u2014\u2009to ensure we\r\ncontinue to attract retain and develop the best talent\r\nBy definition this must include equality To deliver\r\na superior employee value equation there must be\r\nsomething in it for everyone\r\nThese are not new or separate strategies They are\r\nnecessary elements of focus in continuing to build\r\nsuperiority in reducing cost to enable investment and\r\nvalue creation and in strengthening our organization\r\nThey are part of the constructive disruption we must\r\ncontinue to lead\r\nMeeting Consumer Customer\r\nEmployee Societal and\r\nInvestor Needs\r\nIn the ever more complex world we live in it is not\r\njust top and bottom line that must be delivered\r\nand balanced We must endeavor to deliver against\r\nthe needs of an increasing number of constituents\r\nThis is especially true in our efforts in Environmental\r\nSocial and Governance ESG where consumer\r\ncustomer employee society and shareowner\r\nexpectations are growing As I shared earlier our consumers increasingly rely on\r\nus to deliver superior solutions that are sustainable\r\nOur world requires that we do our part in this regard\r\nThis challenge is also an opportunity to extend our\r\nmargin of superiority further grow categories and\r\ncreate more value all while improving our own\r\nenvironmental impact enabling consumers to\r\nreduce their footprint and helping society solve\r\nsome of the most pressing global challenges Our Community Impact work helps improve lives\r\nfor people in difficult times by providing clean water\r\nand donations of product time and money to those\r\naffected by natural disasters and crises around the\r\nworld It is also part of what employees are proud\r\nof and value in PG The ability to do good for the\r\ncommunities we live and work in also helps us\r\nattract and retain the best talent\r\nWe know we increase our chances of winning when\r\nwe have an equal diverse and inclusive culture that\r\ngives life to the best thoughts and ideas\u2009\u2014\u2009a culture\r\nwhere everyone can succeed and is able to be their best\r\nExternally we support equality and inclusion efforts\r\nwith our business partners and in the communities\r\nwhere we live and work because it is not only the right\r\nthing to do but it also can improve income and wealth\r\nequity for more people creating more purchasing\r\npower which drives market growth\r\nOur foundation is our Purpose Values and Principles\r\nwhich set a high standard for each PG person High\r\nstandards are good They require that we hold ourselves\r\nand each other accountable for results and equally\r\nimportant for how we achieve those results Last\r\nyear we added an ESG factor to our annual incentive\r\ncompensation program for our senior executives as\r\na demonstration of our commitment to nearterm\r\nprogress toward our longterm ESG goals\r\nServing and balancing the needs of consumers\r\ncustomers employees society and shareowners\r\nwill not be easy but it is necessary\u2009\u2014\u2009and those\r\nthat do it best as I expect we will should thrive Looking Forward\r\nThe integrated strategies we have outlined here\r\nwere delivering strong results before the pandemic\r\nThey served us well during the more recent volatile\r\ntimes They remain the right strategic choices to drive\r\nbalanced growth and value creation We endeavor\r\nto step forward into the challenges we face not back\r\ngrowing through nearterm challenges while serving\r\nconsumers and communities We are doing this in\r\nour interest in society\u2019s interest and in the interest\r\nof our longterm shareowners\r\nConfidence in our future success is rooted in my\r\nconfidence in PG people Every day PG people\r\ndemonstrate their commitment to our Purpose\r\nValues and

more than\r\n13 billion in annual sales and roughly 5 billion in\r\naftertax profit\u2009\u2014\u2009executing our integrated strategies\r\nwith excellence\r\nThe progress we have made and our collective\r\ncommitment to our strategies give me confidence we\r\ncan manage through the challenges we will continue\r\nii \u2022 The Procter  Gamble Company\r\nto face Still we are cleareyed about the trials ahead\r\nThe operational cost and currency challenges we dealt\r\nwith over the last two years will continue in fiscal year\r\n2023 and we begin the new fiscal year with consumers\r\nfacing inflation levels not seen in the last 40 years\r\nThe best response to the uncertainties and\r\nchallenges\u2009\u2014\u2009double down on the integrated set of\r\nstrategies that are delivering very strong results\r\nWe are focused on delighting and serving consumers\r\ncustomers society and shareowners through five\r\nstrategic and integrated choices a portfolio of dailyuse products in categories where performance drives\r\nbrand choice superiority across product package\r\nbrand communication retail execution and value\r\nproductivity in everything we do constructive\r\ndisruption across the value chain and an agile\r\naccountable and empowered organization\r\nThese are not independent strategic choices They\r\nreinforce and build on each other and when executed\r\nwell they lead to balanced top and bottomline\r\ngrowth and value creation There is still meaningful\r\nopportunity for improvement and leverage in every\r\nfacet of this strategy and we continue to work to\r\nstrengthen our execution of these choices\r\nA Portfolio of Superior\r\nDailyUse Products\r\nPG has a focused portfolio of dailyuse products\r\n\u2009\u2014\u2009many providing cleaning health and hygiene\r\nbenefits\u2009\u2014\u2009in 10 categories where performance drives\r\nbrand choice Fabric Care Home Care Baby Care\r\nFeminine Care Family Care Hair Care Skin  Personal\r\nCare Oral Care Personal Health Care and Grooming\r\nWe know how to win in these categories\u2009\u2014\u2009by delivering\r\nirresistibly superior propositions to our consumers\r\nand retail partners across product performance\r\npackaging brand communication retail execution\r\nand value Continued investment in these five vectors\r\nof superiority is critical to drive sustainable business\r\ngrowth Even when our costs are rising sharply we\r\nwill not diverge from this strategy especially when\r\nconsumers are ever more focused on the performance\r\nand value of the brands they choose\r\nSuperiority to Win\r\nwith Consumers\r\nWe continue to raise the bar on all aspects of superiority\u2009\r\n \u2014\u2009product package brand communication retail\r\nexecution and value\u2009\u2014\u2009in all price tiers where we compete We are leveraging this superiority to grow markets\r\nand PG\u2019s share in them as a way to sustainably build\r\nthe business Creating new business is powerful with\r\nour retail partners as we work to jointly create value\r\nSuperiority is especially critical in an inflationary\r\nenvironment As consumers face increased pressure\r\non nearly every aspect of their household budgets\r\nwe invest to deliver truly superior value through a\r\ncombination of price and product performance to\r\nearn their loyalty every day We are committed to keep\r\ninvesting to strengthen the superiority of our brands\r\nacross innovation supply chains and brand equity to\r\ndeliver superior value for consumers\r\nOngoing Productivity\r\nThe strategic need for investment to strengthen the\r\nlongterm health and competitiveness of our brands\r\nthe shortterm need to manage through significant\r\ncost increases and the ongoing need to drive balanced\r\ntop and bottomline growth including margin\r\nexpansion underscore the importance of productivity\r\nWe have developed a strong productivity muscle\r\nover the last decade as we delivered two 10 billion\r\nsavings programs Productivity is part of our DNA\r\nnow which will help us address some of the challenges\r\nwe face We remain fully committed to cost and cash\r\nproductivity in all facets of our business No area of cost\r\nis left untouched\r\nFor example as COVID19 supply chain challenges ease\r\nand we reach a better balance of supply and demand\r\nwe will have an increased opportunity to implement\r\ncost savings projects in our manufacturing operations\r\nAs we leverage digital tools and automation there\r\nwill be more opportunities to focus employees on the\r\nhigherorder work of serving consumers And as we\r\ncontinue to integrate data and analytics and artificial\r\nintelligence brand teams will be working to make\r\nour marketing investments even more efficient and\r\neffective to deliver improved demand creation at equal\r\nor lower cost\r\nEach business is driving productivity up and down\r\ntheir income statement and across their balance sheet\r\nand we remain fully committed to productivity as a\r\ncore driver of balanced top and bottomline growth\r\nand strong cash generation We cannot let up here\r\nProductivity will remain a significant part of our work\r\nespecially now A Constructive\r\nDisruption Mindset\r\nSuccess in our highly competitive industry\r\nalso requires agility that comes with a mindset\r\nof constructive disruption\u2009\u2014\u2009a willingness to\r\nchange adapt and create new trends and\r\ntechnologies that will shape our industry\r\nfor the future A mindset of constructive\r\ndisruption is even more important in this\r\nchallenging environment\r\nA good example of constructive disruption\r\nin a category is Dawn Powerwash Dish\r\nSpray which addresses the changing habit of\r\nwashing dishes as you go instead of waiting\r\nuntil the end of a meal The product enables\r\ndirect application of activated suds to dishes\r\nto speed up the entire process saving people\r\nnot only time but also water\r\nAnother example is how we continue to\r\nreinvent brand building including how\r\nwe reach consumers more effectively and\r\nefficiently Pampers our largest and most\r\nglobal brand is relatively unique in that\r\nits primary audience is narrow parents of\r\nchildren at diapering age To reach these\r\nparents more precisely Pampers created the\r\nPampers Rewards app so parents can receive\r\nhelpful information tips deals and rewards\r\nWith this app Pampers was able to build\r\nsmart audiences to reach parents at different\r\nstages\u2009\u2014\u2009like newborns crawling and potty\r\ntraining\u2009\u2014\u2009with more precise advertising\r\nspecifically designed for each media platform\r\nincreasing the brand\u2019s reach effectiveness\r\nand efficiency while driving cost savings\r\nSuccess in our highly competitive industry\r\nrequires the agility that comes with a\r\nmindset of constructive disruption\u2009\u2014\u2009An Empowered Agile and\r\nAccountable Organization\r\nWe strive for an empowered agile and accountable\r\norganization with little overlap or redundancy\u2009\u2014\u2009\r\nflowing to new demands and seamlessly supporting\r\neach other through a culture of equality and inclusion\r\nto deliver against our priorities around the world\r\nPG is organized around five industrybased\r\nsector business units SBUs These five sectors\r\nmanage our 10 product categories with full sales\r\nprofit cash and value creation responsibility for our\r\nlargest and most profitable markets\u2009\u2014\u2009called Focus\r\nMarkets\u2009\u2014\u2009accounting for about 80 of Company\r\nsales and about 90 of aftertax profit\r\nEnterprise Markets which represent the rest of the\r\nworld are a separate unit with sales profit and value\r\ncreation responsibility Over the last several years\r\nwe have been growing both top and bottom line in\r\nnearly all of these markets which are important to\r\nthe future of PG\r\nThe best proof that this organization design is working\r\nis the growth of our largest and most profitable market\r\nNorth America whose growth has accelerated since\r\nwe put this design in place Organic sales in North\r\nAmerica have increased from an average of 2 the\r\nthree years prior to the design change to 8 in the\r\nthree years since\r\nThis structure and its resulting organizational speed\r\nand focus has also allowed us to manage through\r\nthe challenges and headwinds we are experiencing\r\nWe continue to believe that this structure\u2009\u2014\u2009with the\r\nSBUs squarely concentrated on Focus Markets and\r\nmanaging Enterprise Markets as a separate operating\r\nunit\u2009\u2014\u2009is the best way to navigate successfully through\r\nthe increasingly dynamic world in which we live\r\nOperating through five industrybased Sector Business Units\r\nProviding greater clarity on\r\nresponsibilities and reporting lines\r\nStrengthening leadership\r\naccountability\r\nEnabling PG people to accelerate\r\ngrowth and value creation\r\nStrengthening Our Strategy\r\nOne of the most important things about our strategy\u2009\r\n \u2014\u2009portfolio superiority productivity constructive\r\ndisruption and an empowered agile and accountable\r\norganization\u2009\u2014\u2009is that it is inherently dynamic not static\r\nIt requires being responsive to changing consumer\r\nneeds and habits It demands we serve evolving\r\ncustomer needs in rapidly transforming channels\r\nGoing forward we have identified four areas to be\r\neven more deliberate and intentional about pursuing\r\nto further strengthen the execution of our strategy\r\nThe first is Supply We are improving our supply chain\r\ncapacity agility cost efficiency and resilience for a new\r\nreality and a new age The capability investments we\r\nmade prior to COVID19 to improve our manufacturing\r\nand distribution networks in the US and Europe\r\nhelped us to manage through the last few years with\r\nrelatively few prolonged issues We are already making\r\nthe next round of investments needed to ensure\r\nwe have multiple qualified suppliers for key inputs\r\nsufficient manufacturing capacity to satisfy growing\r\ndemand and flexibility to meet the changing needs\r\nof all types of retailers\r\nThe second area is Environmental Sustainability\r\nWe are integrating sustainability into our product\r\npackaging and supply chain innovation work to develop\r\nirresistibly superior offerings for consumers that are\r\nbetter for the environment For example our new\r\ncardboard packaging on Gillette razors reduces plastic\r\npackaging and offers a noticeably superior experience\r\nfor consumers at the first and second moments of\r\ntruth Another example is our new fully recyclable\r\npaper packaging on our premium Always Cotton\r\nProtection pads recently launched in Germany One\r\nmore example is coldwater washing with Tide and\r\nAriel When people turn their wash cycles to cold they\r\ncan save up to 90 of the energy used on every load\r\nof laundry while saving money They also get greater\r\nsatisfaction because their colors look brighter and their\r\nclothes look newer longer Better for the consumer\r\nbetter for our planet\r\nThird we are increasing our Digital Acumen to drive\r\nconsumer and customer preference reduce cost and\r\nenable rapid and efficient decision making Increased\r\nThe Procter  Gamble Company \u2022 vii\r\ndigitization of our manufacturing lines more use\r\nof artificial intelligence and more use of blockchain\r\ntechnology are not ends unto themselves They are\r\ntools we can use to delight consumers and customers\r\nFourth a Superior Employee Value Equation for all\r\ngender identities races ethnicities sexual orientations\r\nages and abilities\u2009\u2014\u2009for all roles\u2009\u2014\u2009to ensure we\r\ncontinue to attract retain and develop the best talent\r\nBy definition this must include equality To deliver\r\na superior employee value equation there must be\r\nsomething in it for everyone\r\nThese are not new or separate strategies They are\r\nnecessary elements of focus in continuing to build\r\nsuperiority in reducing cost to enable investment and\r\nvalue creation and in strengthening our organization\r\nThey are part of the constructive disruption we must\r\ncontinue to lead\r\nMeeting Consumer Customer\r\nEmployee Societal and\r\nInvestor Needs\r\nIn the ever more complex world we live in it is not\r\njust top and bottom line that must be delivered\r\nand balanced We must endeavor to deliver against\r\nthe needs of an increasing number of constituents\r\nThis is especially true in our efforts in Environmental\r\nSocial and Governance ESG where consumer\r\ncustomer employee society and shareowner\r\nexpectations are growing As I shared earlier our consumers increasingly rely on\r\nus to deliver superior solutions that are sustainable\r\nOur world requires that we do our part in this regard\r\nThis challenge is also an opportunity to extend our\r\nmargin of superiority further grow categories and\r\ncreate more value all while improving our own\r\nenvironmental impact enabling consumers to\r\nreduce their footprint and helping society solve\r\nsome of the most pressing global challenges Our Community Impact work helps improve lives\r\nfor people in difficult times by providing clean water\r\nand donations of product time and money to those\r\naffected by natural disasters and crises around the\r\nworld It is also part of what employees are proud\r\nof and value in PG The ability to do good for the\r\ncommunities we live and work in also helps us\r\nattract and retain the best talent\r\nWe know we increase our chances of winning when\r\nwe have an equal diverse and inclusive culture that\r\ngives life to the best thoughts and ideas\u2009\u2014\u2009a culture\r\nwhere everyone can succeed and is able to be their best\r\nExternally we support equality and inclusion efforts\r\nwith our business partners and in the communities\r\nwhere we live and work because it is not only the right\r\nthing to do but it also can improve income and wealth\r\nequity for more people creating more purchasing\r\npower which drives market growth\r\nOur foundation is our Purpose Values and Principles\r\nwhich set a high standard for each PG person High\r\nstandards are good They require that we hold ourselves\r\nand each other accountable for results and equally\r\nimportant for how we achieve those results Last\r\nyear we added an ESG factor to our annual incentive\r\ncompensation program for our senior executives as\r\na demonstration of our commitment to nearterm\r\nprogress toward our longterm ESG goals\r\nServing and balancing the needs of consumers\r\ncustomers employees society and shareowners\r\nwill not be easy but it is necessary\u2009\u2014\u2009and those\r\nthat do it best as I expect we will should thrive Looking Forward\r\nThe integrated strategies we have outlined here\r\nwere delivering strong results before the pandemic\r\nThey served us well during the more recent volatile\r\ntimes They remain the right strategic choices to drive\r\nbalanced growth and value creation We endeavor\r\nto step forward into the challenges we face not back\r\ngrowing through nearterm challenges while serving\r\nconsumers and communities We are doing this in\r\nour interest in society\u2019s interest and in the interest\r\nof our longterm shareowners\r\nConfidence in our future success is rooted in my\r\nconfidence in PG people Every day PG people\r\ndemonstrate their commitment to our Purpose\r\nValues and

works We entered the year with a clear strategy for GE\u2019s path ahead and faced a world that looked quite different from what we expected We experienced inflationary pressures not seen since the 1980s geopolitical conflict global supply chain challenges and an enduring pandemic In these times we focused on \u201ccontrolling the controllable\u201d as my mentor at Danaher and GE alumnus George Sherman used to say and by doing so we advanced our plans to create independent industryleading public companies We maintained our daytoday focus of meeting customer commitments and made significant operational progress while delivering strong financial performance GE ended the year with solid revenue growth and margin expansion and 48 billion of free cash flow GE Aerospace led the way with order and revenue growth above 20 for the year and Power delivered doubledigit order growth organically and achieved highsingledigit margins And today excluding GE HealthCare highermargin and more resilient

Chemami Operations and Maintenance Specialist at Gas Power wrote to me in November of 2022 as GE marked the oneyear anniversary of the announcement of our spin plans This message stuck with me Throughout our journey over the past four years\u2014step by step\u2014we have built a stronger GE Our first priority was to reduce our debt load and we have done so by over 100 billion since 2018\u2014no small feat Often there were hard decisions to make but those choices have given us optionality to play more offense both organically and inorganically Today our balance sheet is solid and we are operating from a position of strength We are also focused on changing the way we work A lean mindset focuses on safety quality delivery and cost SQDC\u2014in that order\u2014 and gives us the tools and instincts to make the right decisions and necessary tradeoffs By deeply embedding lean principles and tools we are creating a problemsolving culture and serving our customers\u00a0better While developing a lean mindset takes many years we are gaining ground At our GE Aerospace site in Greenville South Carolina our team performs complex machining operations and detailed inspections on highpressure turbine blades With a clear focus on reducing blade delivery lead time the team created standard lines which in turn improved part flow This has reduced lead time by more than 10 days with a clear target for more reduction to come improving our operations for our customers and reducing inventory This is just one of the countless examples of effective utilization of lean across GE Our progress on these priorities has made our foundation strong enough to launch three companies More than a year after this announcement the logic behind\u2014and our conviction in\u2014our historic transformation has only strengthened Along the way the feedback from our customers investors employees and other stakeholders has been overwhelmingly positive Let\u2019s take a closer look at our businesses GE Aerospace At GE Aerospace we have a tremendously talented team a highly differentiated product and technology portfolio leading positions in attractive commercial and military sectors and a bold vision for the future of flight In 2022 nearly 3 billion people flew with our technology under wing We have nearly 41000 commercial engines1 at work in more than 70 of global airlines and a diverse portfolio of more than 26000 military engines We take that responsibility seriously living our purpose to invent the future of flight lift people up and bring them home safely A highlight in 2022 was being with the team and our customers at the Farnborough International Airshow\u2014the industry\u2019s first major gathering since the pandemic began As I looked across the tarmac and saw so many of our engines under wing I felt a deep sense of pride and appreciation\u2014for our employees who make it possible and for our customers who put their trust in us GE Aerospace\u2019s Tatum Ross is a Lead Manufacturing Engineer in Evendale Ohio seen here with a Passport engine A WINNING VALUE PROPOSITION It\u2019s now been three years since the start of the pandemic and the world is eager to travel The commercial market recovery continues and we expect total departures to return to 2019 levels in late 2023 GE Aerospace is uniquely positioned to serve this market as customers expand and upgrade their fleets Today we have new engines in each market segment that offer doubledigit fuel burn reduction lowering one of our customers\u2019 greatest variable costs In 2022 CFM International our joint venture with Safran was selected by Delta Air Lines to deliver 200 CFM LEAP1B engines to power its new fleet of Boeing 73710 aircraft with options for up to 60 additional engines We also signed an order with Qatar Airways for GE9X engines to propel up to 50 of its Boeing 7778 Freighters as well as a services agreement to cover the maintenance repair and overhaul MRO of these engines Commercial departures are a leading indicator of shop visit demand which we expect to grow by double digits in the year ahead We have a diversified services portfolio with an extensive MRO network providing us with full flexibility to meet customer needs This year both Delta TechOps and Air France Industries KLM Engineering  We invent the future of flight lift people up and bring them home safely 1 Including GE and its joint venture partners 2  GE 2022 ANNUAL REPORT WE RISE TO THE CHALLENGE OF BUILDING A WORLD THAT\u00a0WORKS Maintenance joined the global network of LEAP MRO facilities as we work to expand shop visit capacity for the rapidly growing fleet This is one of many highlights of how we are continuing to serve our\u00a0customers On the military side national defense budgets are growing In the US alone the Department of Defense increased its fiscal 2023 budget by 4 Our business is focused on winning core platforms Our groundbreaking XA100 fighter engine is the first and only adaptive cycle engine to successfully complete testing with the US Air Force confirming our ability to deliver 30 more range and twice the thermal management capability of the incumbent engine on the F35 aircraft In the face of rising geopolitical threats we stand ready to bring this innovative engine that pairs power with efficiency to the F35 fighter jet before the end of this decade In the rotorcraft segment we began testing our T901 turboshaft engine selected by the US Army to replace our ubiquitous T700 powering the Black Hawk and Apache helicopters as well as the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft And we continue to expand our international efforts with allied nations for example powering South Korea\u2019s KF21 Boramae fighter with our F414 engines DELIVERING STRONG GROWTH IN 2022 Delivering on this unprecedented ramp starts with our team The GE Aerospace leadership team balances unparalleled experience with fresh perspective with nearly half of the leaders new to their roles in the past year We see an opportunity to accelerate our lean progress both within GE Aerospace and with our partners suppliers and customers We have improved our operating rhythms moving to a more frequent weekly and monthly cadence for each of our PLs This helps us manage the business in real time and deliver better faster and more efficiently in a highly dynamic environment To help improve engine delivery for example we reprioritized 20 of our existing engineers to solve problems closer to the point of impact and quicker through daily management As a result engine output was up year over year This year we have taken steps to vertically integrate our PLs further driving focus within the portfolio For example in our Commercial Engines and Services business we are increasingly running our product lines as their own PLs aligned with how our customers work with us And we moved the Electric Power and Avionics teams to our Military business aligning PLs with a strong military customer base This granularity is improving our process capabilities especially within our supply chain and driving accountability closer to the customer Taken together lean and decentralization are making a real impact For the year revenue was up 23 organically driven by Commercial Services with internal shop visits up over 20 Margins were 183 and free cash flow was 49 billion driven by earnings and working\u00a0capital GE Aerospace lab specialist Dakota Martin inspects spools of Ceramic Matrix Composite fiber a centerpiece of GE Aerospace\u2019s 21st century commercial and military engine\u00a0strategy SHAPING THE FUTURE OF FLIGHT GE Aerospace has a bright future and as the company that defines flight for the next generation we have not taken our eye off our mission to create a smarter and more efficient future of flight We are continuing our efforts to support use of sustainable aviation fuel or SAF which is vital to enabling the airline industry to meet its decarbonization goals The revolutionary CFM RISE Technology Demonstration Program is the manifestation of the deep commitment GE and Safran share for achieving ambitious goals for a sustainable future Leveraging an open fan architecture hybrid electric capability and key materials technologies like additive manufacturing and ceramic matrix composites CMCs this program is aiming to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by more than 20 compared with today\u2019s most efficient engines In 2022 we announced a new flight test program for a hydrogen combustion engine and an open fan flight test demonstration both with Airbus In hybrid electric we are working with NASA and Boeing to fly a megawattclass hybrid electric system And our Avio Aero team will lead a European project to test a hybrid electric motor powered by hydrogen fuel cells Overall GE Aerospace is an exceptional franchise The quality of our technology and product development plans the energy and collaboration of our team and our unique positioning as the industry\u2019s largest and youngest fleet give us confidence that this business will generate significant value for decades to come We are united by a single urgent purpose to electrify and decarbonize the planet because together we have the energy to change the world We are not only building a healthier future but living our purpose to

maintenance on a 2\u00a0MW wind turbine at Pattern\u2019s Western Spirit wind farm in New\u00a0Mexico AT THE CENTER OF A DYNAMIC AND GROWING MARKET GE Vernova sits at the center of a dynamic and growing market External catalysts including US climate legislation and constraints in the European energy market are increasing investment in new decarbonization technologies an area where GE Vernova\u2019s portfolio is uniquely positioned to lead These catalysts also improve the longterm economic profile of the underlying businesses The US Inflation Reduction Act is gamechanging It provides the certainty and stability our Renewable Energy customers need to make longterm investments especially in onshore wind GE Vernova\u2019s decarbonization technologies are aligned with the 370 billion in tax credits the bill provides Additionally the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provides at least 65 billion for investment in grid nuclear and breakthrough technologies With Europe seeking to address energy security concerns there is renewed urgency to reduce emissions and make energy more resilient and there is pragmatism in doing so The new EU taxonomy for example reinforces the important roles of gas and nuclear alongside renewables Our customers in the region are engaging our full technology roadmap including wind hydropower gas fuel blends and grid Global gas generation and utilization continues to grow with strength in Europe and the US While we saw volatility in gas prices and availability this year gas remains a fuel of choice on dispatch curves globally to meet growing electricity demand and we continue to plan for a gas turbine market of 25 to 30 gigawatts annually MAKING PROGRESS  PREPARING TO SPIN While these trends provide tailwinds for GE Vernova over time external pressures faced in 2022 impacted business performance Power delivered solid performance Gas Power grew driven by services strength and aeroderivative momentum We continued to advance our turnaround at Power Conversion focus on services at Steam Power and deliver innovation at GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy This progress enabled us to deliver doubledigit orders growth organically with growth across each business achieve highsingledigit margins with significant margin expansion and improve free cash flow of A STRONG RECORD OF\u00a0LEADERSHIP 4  NonGAAP Financial Measure  GE 2022 ANNUAL REPORT 19 billion for the year Services continues to be a major driver of our business performance and improvement and we are well positioned for continued growth with our expanded HA fleet Scott Strazik CEO of GE Vernova who successfully led the Gas Power business is now running a similar strategy at Renewable Energy Onshore Wind is an 8 billion annual revenue business where we have added over 40 gigawatts to the grid However like most of the industry this business has faced challenges due to the US production tax credit PTC lapse which reduced 2022 demand Additionally cost has been a challenge with inflation and rapid innovation straining quality We moved quickly to enhance product quality and reduce costs We deployed corrective measures in our existing fleet to increase availability reduced fixed costs which included the difficult but necessary step of decreasing our global headcount and are more selective on the projects we bid on to ensure we\u2019re executing profitably Offshore Wind is transitioning to approximately 500 million in annual revenue and growing We installed and commissioned 80 turbines for EDF on schedule and now our focus shifts to our 7gigawatt HaliadeX\u00a0backlog Grid is a 3 billion annual revenue business where market demand in automation and hardware remains strong In the fourth quarter of 2022 we saw a major inflection point\u2014Grid was profitable for the first time since 2018 reflecting our restructuring and selectivity efforts and orders also grew significantly Lean continues to generate new opportunities for sustained improvement across GE Vernova and in turn for our customers For example Gas Power Services\u2019 business playbook for planned maintenance outage events called Live Outage hosts all critical content and standard procedures that field crews need at their fingertips Initially launched in the United States at power plants powered by GE 7F gas turbines it helped complete outages safely with a substantial reduction in cycle time getting our customers\u2019 turbine back online sooner In 2022 Live Outage expanded to the Europe and the Middle East for GE 9F turbines LEADING A NEW ERA OF ENERGY The planned spinoff of GE Vernova comes as the world faces a 50 increase in electricity demand over the next two decades Against this backdrop the strategic imperative to electrify and decarbonize the world is a challenge that GE Vernova was made to meet In the US Power secured an order from Kindle Energy in Louisiana to provide HClass power generation equipment Initially fueled by natural gas it has the ability to use up to 50 hydrogen by volume In Vietnam Power secured its first new 9HA02 combinedcycle power plant order which is expected to improve the reliability and stability of the energy grid to support renewables penetration Renewable Energy along with Invenergy completed the largest wind farm in North America in a single phase Notably the Traverse Wind Energy Center is powered by more than 350 of our 2megawatt platform turbines Hydro Solutions signed orders with a total generating capacity of 7 gigawatts in 2022 and GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy is working with several customers including Ontario Power Generation in Canada to deploy advanced nuclear technologies like our BWRX300 small modular reactor which produces no carbon during operation I\u2019m excited about our plans for the future of GE Vernova Combining Renewable Energy Power and Digital into one business brings together unique experience talented people and a pioneering spirit that can power the future while also helping decarbonize the world GE HealthCare Big picture GE HealthCare operates in an attractive growing market fueled by global trends including the aging population chronic disease and the rise of the middle class in developing markets The healthcare industry is also facing challenges in improving productivity harnessing patient data more effectively and extending care out of the hospital to alternative care sites There is no medical technology company better suited to address these challenges GE HealthCare is a new company and one with extensive scale\u2014 serving 1 billion patients across 2 billion procedures a year\u2014and profound global reach with almost 60 of annual sales outside the US It also has more than 4 million equipment installations and upgrades to the fleet help the business create value and stay close to customers Investing 1 billion in research and development annually GE HealthCare remains at the forefront of innovation Geetha BP in the GE HealthCare plant in Bangalore India where high voltage amplifiers for MR subsystems tubes and generators are\u00a0made With the spin GE effectively distributed a 30 billion dividend in the form of GE HealthCare shares while retaining an approximately 199 stake in the company And shareholders in the new GE HealthCare are already seeing value unlocked as the independent company embarks on its important mission to create a world where healthcare has no limits Creating Value Today  Tomorrow GE Board Member and former US Secretary of Defense Ash Carter sadly passed away in October We miss him every day and again express our deepest sympathies to his wife and family Ash once said to me \u201cI like the ethos of GE\u201d and how GE sits on the same side of the table with customers when it comes to technology and efficient production I couldn\u2019t agree more We approach our work with our customers as \u201cone team with one fight\u201d as Ash would describe it That was as true this past year as it was for the more than 130 years that came before it and we will carry that ethos into our future 2022 marked the beginning of a new era

works We entered the year with a clear strategy for GE\u2019s path ahead and faced a world that looked quite different from what we expected We experienced inflationary pressures not seen since the 1980s geopolitical conflict global supply chain challenges and an enduring pandemic In these times we focused on \u201ccontrolling the controllable\u201d as my mentor at Danaher and GE alumnus George Sherman used to say and by doing so we advanced our plans to create independent industryleading public companies We maintained our daytoday focus of meeting customer commitments and made significant operational progress while delivering strong financial performance GE ended the year with solid revenue growth and margin expansion and 48 billion of free cash flow GE Aerospace led the way with order and revenue growth above 20 for the year and Power delivered doubledigit order growth organically and achieved highsingledigit margins And today excluding GE HealthCare highermargin and more resilient services represent an even larger part of our portfolio at approximately 60 of our revenue This was all made possible by our team\u2019s embedding lean more deeply putting our customers first and

Chemami Operations and Maintenance Specialist at Gas Power wrote to me in November of 2022 as GE marked the oneyear anniversary of the announcement of our spin plans This message stuck with me Throughout our journey over the past four years\u2014step by step\u2014we have built a stronger GE Our first priority was to reduce our debt load and we have done so by over 100 billion since 2018\u2014no small feat Often there were hard decisions to make but those choices have given us optionality to play more offense both organically and inorganically Today our balance sheet is solid and we are operating from a position of strength We are also focused on changing the way we work A lean mindset focuses on safety quality delivery and cost SQDC\u2014in that order\u2014 and gives us the tools and instincts to make the right decisions and necessary tradeoffs By deeply embedding lean principles and tools we are creating a problemsolving culture and serving our customers\u00a0better While developing a lean mindset takes many years we are gaining ground At our GE Aerospace site in Greenville South Carolina our team performs complex machining operations and detailed inspections on highpressure turbine blades With a clear focus on reducing blade delivery lead time the team created standard lines which in turn improved part flow This has reduced lead time by more than 10 days with a clear target for more reduction to come improving our operations for our customers and reducing inventory This is just one of the countless examples of effective utilization of lean across GE Our progress on these priorities has made our foundation strong enough to launch three companies More than a year after this announcement the logic behind\u2014and our conviction in\u2014our historic transformation has only strengthened Along the way the feedback from our customers investors employees and other stakeholders has been overwhelmingly positive Let\u2019s take a closer look at our businesses GE Aerospace At GE Aerospace we have a tremendously talented team a highly differentiated product and technology portfolio leading positions in attractive commercial and military sectors and a bold vision for the future of flight In 2022 nearly 3 billion people flew with our technology under wing We have nearly 41000 commercial engines1 at work in more than 70 of global airlines and a diverse portfolio of more than 26000 military engines We take that responsibility seriously living our purpose to invent the future of flight lift people up and bring them home safely A highlight in 2022 was being with the team and our customers at the Farnborough International Airshow\u2014the industry\u2019s first major gathering since the pandemic began As I looked across the tarmac and saw so many of our engines under wing I felt a deep sense of pride and appreciation\u2014for our employees who make it possible and for our customers who put their trust in us GE Aerospace\u2019s Tatum Ross is a Lead Manufacturing Engineer in Evendale Ohio seen here with a Passport engine A WINNING VALUE PROPOSITION It\u2019s now been three years since the start of the pandemic and the world is eager to travel The commercial market recovery continues and we expect total departures to return to 2019 levels in late 2023 GE Aerospace is uniquely positioned to serve this market as customers expand and upgrade their fleets Today we have new engines in each market segment that offer doubledigit fuel burn reduction lowering one of our customers\u2019 greatest variable costs In 2022 CFM International our joint venture with Safran was selected by Delta Air Lines to deliver 200 CFM LEAP1B engines to power its new fleet of Boeing 73710 aircraft with options for up to 60 additional engines We also signed an order with Qatar Airways for GE9X engines to propel up to 50 of its Boeing 7778 Freighters as well as a services agreement to cover the maintenance repair and overhaul MRO of these engines Commercial departures are a leading indicator of shop visit demand which we expect to grow by double digits in the year ahead We have a diversified services portfolio with an extensive MRO network providing us with full flexibility to meet customer needs This year both Delta TechOps and Air France Industries KLM Engineering  We invent the future of flight lift people up and bring them home safely 1 Including GE and its joint venture partners 2  GE 2022 ANNUAL REPORT WE RISE TO THE CHALLENGE OF BUILDING A WORLD THAT\u00a0WORKS Maintenance joined the global network of LEAP MRO facilities as we work to expand shop visit capacity for the rapidly growing fleet This is one of many highlights of how we are continuing to serve our\u00a0customers On the military side national defense budgets are growing In the US alone the Department of Defense increased its fiscal 2023 budget by 4 Our business is focused on winning core platforms Our groundbreaking XA100 fighter engine is the first and only adaptive cycle engine to successfully complete testing with the US Air Force confirming our ability to deliver 30 more range and twice the thermal management capability of the incumbent engine on the F35 aircraft In the face of rising geopolitical threats we stand ready to bring this innovative engine that pairs power with efficiency to the F35 fighter jet before the end of this decade In the rotorcraft segment we began testing our T901 turboshaft engine selected by the US Army to replace our ubiquitous T700 powering the Black Hawk and Apache helicopters as well as the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft And we continue to expand our international efforts with allied nations for example powering South Korea\u2019s KF21 Boramae fighter with our F414 engines DELIVERING STRONG GROWTH IN 2022 Delivering on this unprecedented ramp starts with our team The GE Aerospace leadership team balances unparalleled experience with fresh perspective with nearly half of the leaders new to their roles in the past year We see an opportunity to accelerate our lean progress both within GE Aerospace and with our partners suppliers and customers We have improved our operating rhythms moving to a more frequent weekly and monthly cadence for each of our PLs This helps us manage the business in real time and deliver better faster and more efficiently in a highly dynamic environment To help improve engine delivery for example we reprioritized 20 of our existing engineers to solve problems closer to the point of impact and quicker through daily management As a result engine output was up year over year This year we have taken steps to vertically integrate our PLs further driving focus within the portfolio For example in our Commercial Engines and Services business we are increasingly running our product lines as their own PLs aligned with how our customers work with us And we moved the Electric Power and Avionics teams to our Military business aligning PLs with a strong military customer base This granularity is improving our process capabilities especially within our supply chain and driving accountability closer to the customer Taken together lean and decentralization are making a real impact For the year revenue was up 23 organically driven by Commercial Services with internal shop visits up over 20 Margins were 183 and free cash flow was 49 billion driven by earnings and working\u00a0capital GE Aerospace lab specialist Dakota Martin inspects spools of Ceramic Matrix Composite fiber a centerpiece of GE Aerospace\u2019s 21st century commercial and military engine\u00a0strategy SHAPING THE FUTURE OF FLIGHT GE Aerospace has a bright future and as the company that defines flight for the next generation we have not taken our eye off our mission to create a smarter and more efficient future of flight We are continuing our efforts to support use of sustainable aviation fuel or SAF which is vital to enabling the airline industry to meet its decarbonization goals The revolutionary CFM RISE Technology Demonstration Program is the manifestation of the deep commitment GE and Safran share for achieving ambitious goals for a sustainable future Leveraging an open fan architecture hybrid electric capability and key materials technologies like additive manufacturing and ceramic matrix composites CMCs this program is aiming to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by more than 20 compared with today\u2019s most efficient engines In 2022 we announced a new flight test program for a hydrogen combustion engine and an open fan flight test demonstration both with Airbus In hybrid electric we are working with NASA and Boeing to fly a megawattclass hybrid electric system And our Avio Aero team will lead a European project to test a hybrid electric motor powered by hydrogen fuel cells Overall GE Aerospace is an exceptional franchise The quality of our technology and product development plans the energy and collaboration of our team and our unique positioning as the industry\u2019s largest and youngest fleet give us confidence that this business will generate significant value for decades to come We are united by a single urgent purpose to electrify and decarbonize the planet because together we have the energy to change the world We are not only building a healthier future but living our purpose to

maintenance on a 2\u00a0MW wind turbine at Pattern\u2019s Western Spirit wind farm in New\u00a0Mexico AT THE CENTER OF A DYNAMIC AND GROWING MARKET GE Vernova sits at the center of a dynamic and growing market External catalysts including US climate legislation and constraints in the European energy market are increasing investment in new decarbonization technologies an area where GE Vernova\u2019s portfolio is uniquely positioned to lead These catalysts also improve the longterm economic profile of the underlying businesses The US Inflation Reduction Act is gamechanging It provides the certainty and stability our Renewable Energy customers need to make longterm investments especially in onshore wind GE Vernova\u2019s decarbonization technologies are aligned with the 370 billion in tax credits the bill provides Additionally the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provides at least 65 billion for investment in grid nuclear and breakthrough technologies With Europe seeking to address energy security concerns there is renewed urgency to reduce emissions and make energy more resilient and there is pragmatism in doing so The new EU taxonomy for example reinforces the important roles of gas and nuclear alongside renewables Our customers in the region are engaging our full technology roadmap including wind hydropower gas fuel blends and grid Global gas generation and utilization continues to grow with strength in Europe and the US While we saw volatility in gas prices and availability this year gas remains a fuel of choice on dispatch curves globally to meet growing electricity demand and we continue to plan for a gas turbine market of 25 to 30 gigawatts annually MAKING PROGRESS  PREPARING TO SPIN While these trends provide tailwinds for GE Vernova over time external pressures faced in 2022 impacted business performance Power delivered solid performance Gas Power grew driven by services strength and aeroderivative momentum We continued to advance our turnaround at Power Conversion focus on services at Steam Power and deliver innovation at GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy This progress enabled us to deliver doubledigit orders growth organically with growth across each business achieve highsingledigit margins with significant margin expansion and improve free cash flow of A STRONG RECORD OF\u00a0LEADERSHIP 4  NonGAAP Financial Measure  GE 2022 ANNUAL REPORT 19 billion for the year Services continues to be a major driver of our business performance and improvement and we are well positioned for continued growth with our expanded HA fleet Scott Strazik CEO of GE Vernova who successfully led the Gas Power business is now running a similar strategy at Renewable Energy Onshore Wind is an 8 billion annual revenue business where we have added over 40 gigawatts to the grid However like most of the industry this business has faced challenges due to the US production tax credit PTC lapse which reduced 2022 demand Additionally cost has been a challenge with inflation and rapid innovation straining quality We moved quickly to enhance product quality and reduce costs We deployed corrective measures in our existing fleet to increase availability reduced fixed costs which included the difficult but necessary step of decreasing our global headcount and are more selective on the projects we bid on to ensure we\u2019re executing profitably Offshore Wind is transitioning to approximately 500 million in annual revenue and growing We installed and commissioned 80 turbines for EDF on schedule and now our focus shifts to our 7gigawatt HaliadeX\u00a0backlog Grid is a 3 billion annual revenue business where market demand in automation and hardware remains strong In the fourth quarter of 2022 we saw a major inflection point\u2014Grid was profitable for the first time since 2018 reflecting our restructuring and selectivity efforts and orders also grew significantly Lean continues to generate new opportunities for sustained improvement across GE Vernova and in turn for our customers For example Gas Power Services\u2019 business playbook for planned maintenance outage events called Live Outage hosts all critical content and standard procedures that field crews need at their fingertips Initially launched in the United States at power plants powered by GE 7F gas turbines it helped complete outages safely with a substantial reduction in cycle time getting our customers\u2019 turbine back online sooner In 2022 Live Outage expanded to the Europe and the Middle East for GE 9F turbines LEADING A NEW ERA OF ENERGY The planned spinoff of GE Vernova comes as the world faces a 50 increase in electricity demand over the next two decades Against this backdrop the strategic imperative to electrify and decarbonize the world is a challenge that GE Vernova was made to meet In the US Power secured an order from Kindle Energy in Louisiana to provide HClass power generation equipment Initially fueled by natural gas it has the ability to use up to 50 hydrogen by volume In Vietnam Power secured its first new 9HA02 combinedcycle power plant order which is expected to improve the reliability and stability of the energy grid to support renewables penetration Renewable Energy along with Invenergy completed the largest wind farm in North America in a single phase Notably the Traverse Wind Energy Center is powered by more than 350 of our 2megawatt platform turbines Hydro Solutions signed orders with a total generating capacity of 7 gigawatts in 2022 and GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy is working with several customers including Ontario Power Generation in Canada to deploy advanced nuclear technologies like our BWRX300 small modular reactor which produces no carbon during operation I\u2019m excited about our plans for the future of GE Vernova Combining Renewable Energy Power and Digital into one business brings together unique experience talented people and a pioneering spirit that can power the future while also helping decarbonize the world GE HealthCare Big picture GE HealthCare operates in an attractive growing market fueled by global trends including the aging population chronic disease and the rise of the middle class in developing markets The healthcare industry is also facing challenges in improving productivity harnessing patient data more effectively and extending care out of the hospital to alternative care sites There is no medical technology company better suited to address these challenges GE HealthCare is a new company and one with extensive scale\u2014 serving 1 billion patients across 2 billion procedures a year\u2014and profound global reach with almost 60 of annual sales outside the US It also has more than 4 million equipment installations and upgrades to the fleet help the business create value and stay close to customers Investing 1 billion in research and development annually GE HealthCare remains at the forefront of innovation Geetha BP in the GE HealthCare plant in Bangalore India where high voltage amplifiers for MR subsystems tubes and generators are\u00a0made With the spin GE effectively distributed a 30 billion dividend in the form of GE HealthCare shares while retaining an approximately 199 stake in the company And shareholders in the new GE HealthCare are already seeing value unlocked as the independent company embarks on its important mission to create a world where healthcare has no limits Creating Value Today  Tomorrow GE Board Member and former US Secretary of Defense Ash Carter sadly passed away in October We miss him every day and again express our deepest sympathies to his wife and family Ash once said to me \u201cI like the ethos of GE\u201d and how GE sits on the same side of the table with customers when it comes to technology and efficient production I couldn\u2019t agree more We approach our work with our customers as \u201cone team with one fight\u201d as Ash would describe it That was as true this past year as it was for the more than 130 years that came before it and we will carry that ethos into our future 2022 marked the beginning of a new era

works We entered the year with a clear strategy for GE\u2019s path ahead and faced a world that looked quite different from what we expected We experienced inflationary pressures not seen since the 1980s geopolitical conflict global supply chain challenges and an enduring pandemic In these times we focused on \u201ccontrolling the controllable\u201d as my mentor at Danaher and GE alumnus George Sherman used to say and by doing so we advanced our plans to create independent industryleading public companies We maintained our daytoday focus of meeting customer commitments and made significant operational progress while delivering strong financial performance GE ended the year with solid revenue growth and margin expansion and 48 billion of free cash flow GE Aerospace led the way with order and revenue growth above 20 for the year and Power delivered doubledigit order growth organically and achieved highsingledigit margins And today excluding GE HealthCare highermargin and more resilient services represent an even larger part of our portfolio at approximately 60 of our revenue This was all made possible by our team\u2019s embedding lean more deeply putting our customers first and

Chemami Operations and Maintenance Specialist at Gas Power wrote to me in November of 2022 as GE marked the oneyear anniversary of the announcement of our spin plans This message stuck with me Throughout our journey over the past four years\u2014step by step\u2014we have built a stronger GE Our first priority was to reduce our debt load and we have done so by over 100 billion since 2018\u2014no small feat Often there were hard decisions to make but those choices have given us optionality to play more offense both organically and inorganically Today our balance sheet is solid and we are operating from a position of strength We are also focused on changing the way we work A lean mindset focuses on safety quality delivery and cost SQDC\u2014in that order\u2014 and gives us the tools and instincts to make the right decisions and necessary tradeoffs By deeply embedding lean principles and tools we are creating a problemsolving culture and serving our customers\u00a0better While developing a lean mindset takes many years we are gaining ground At our GE Aerospace site in Greenville South Carolina our team performs complex machining operations and detailed inspections on highpressure turbine blades With a clear focus on reducing blade delivery lead time the team created standard lines which in turn improved part flow This has reduced lead time by more than 10 days with a clear target for more reduction to come improving our operations for our customers and reducing inventory This is just one of the countless examples of effective utilization of lean across GE Our progress on these priorities has made our foundation strong enough to launch three companies More than a year after this announcement the logic behind\u2014and our conviction in\u2014our historic transformation has only strengthened Along the way the feedback from our customers investors employees and other stakeholders has been overwhelmingly positive Let\u2019s take a closer look at our businesses GE Aerospace At GE Aerospace we have a tremendously talented team a highly differentiated product and technology portfolio leading positions in attractive commercial and military sectors and a bold vision for the future of flight In 2022 nearly 3 billion people flew with our technology under wing We have nearly 41000 commercial engines1 at work in more than 70 of global airlines and a diverse portfolio of more than 26000 military engines We take that responsibility seriously living our purpose to invent the future of flight lift people up and bring them home safely A highlight in 2022 was being with the team and our customers at the Farnborough International Airshow\u2014the industry\u2019s first major gathering since the pandemic began As I looked across the tarmac and saw so many of our engines under wing I felt a deep sense of pride and appreciation\u2014for our employees who make it possible and for our customers who put their trust in us GE Aerospace\u2019s Tatum Ross is a Lead Manufacturing Engineer in Evendale Ohio seen here with a Passport engine A WINNING VALUE PROPOSITION It\u2019s now been three years since the start of the pandemic and the world is eager to travel The commercial market recovery continues and we expect total departures to return to 2019 levels in late 2023 GE Aerospace is uniquely positioned to serve this market as customers expand and upgrade their fleets Today we have new engines in each market segment that offer doubledigit fuel burn reduction lowering one of our customers\u2019 greatest variable costs In 2022 CFM International our joint venture with Safran was selected by Delta Air Lines to deliver 200 CFM LEAP1B engines to power its new fleet of Boeing 73710 aircraft with options for up to 60 additional engines We also signed an order with Qatar Airways for GE9X engines to propel up to 50 of its Boeing 7778 Freighters as well as a services agreement to cover the maintenance repair and overhaul MRO of these engines Commercial departures are a leading indicator of shop visit demand which we expect to grow by double digits in the year ahead We have a diversified services portfolio with an extensive MRO network providing us with full flexibility to meet customer needs This year both Delta TechOps and Air France Industries KLM Engineering  We invent the future of flight lift people up and bring them home safely 1 Including GE and its joint venture partners 2  GE 2022 ANNUAL REPORT WE RISE TO THE CHALLENGE OF BUILDING A WORLD THAT\u00a0WORKS Maintenance joined the global network of LEAP MRO facilities as we work to expand shop visit capacity for the rapidly growing fleet This is one of many highlights of how we are continuing to serve our\u00a0customers On the military side national defense budgets are growing In the US alone the Department of Defense increased its fiscal 2023 budget by 4 Our business is focused on winning core platforms Our groundbreaking XA100 fighter engine is the first and only adaptive cycle engine to successfully complete testing with the US Air Force confirming our ability to deliver 30 more range and twice the thermal management capability of the incumbent engine on the F35 aircraft In the face of rising geopolitical threats we stand ready to bring this innovative engine that pairs power with efficiency to the F35 fighter jet before the end of this decade In the rotorcraft segment we began testing our T901 turboshaft engine selected by the US Army to replace our ubiquitous T700 powering the Black Hawk and Apache helicopters as well as the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft And we continue to expand our international efforts with allied nations for example powering South Korea\u2019s KF21 Boramae fighter with our F414 engines DELIVERING STRONG GROWTH IN 2022 Delivering on this unprecedented ramp starts with our team The GE Aerospace leadership team balances unparalleled experience with fresh perspective with nearly half of the leaders new to their roles in the past year We see an opportunity to accelerate our lean progress both within GE Aerospace and with our partners suppliers and customers We have improved our operating rhythms moving to a more frequent weekly and monthly cadence for each of our PLs This helps us manage the business in real time and deliver better faster and more efficiently in a highly dynamic environment To help improve engine delivery for example we reprioritized 20 of our existing engineers to solve problems closer to the point of impact and quicker through daily management As a result engine output was up year over year This year we have taken steps to vertically integrate our PLs further driving focus within the portfolio For example in our Commercial Engines and Services business we are increasingly running our product lines as their own PLs aligned with how our customers work with us And we moved the Electric Power and Avionics teams to our Military business aligning PLs with a strong military customer base This granularity is improving our process capabilities especially within our supply chain and driving accountability closer to the customer Taken together lean and decentralization are making a real impact For the year revenue was up 23 organically driven by Commercial Services with internal shop visits up over 20 Margins were 183 and free cash flow was 49 billion driven by earnings and working\u00a0capital GE Aerospace lab specialist Dakota Martin inspects spools of Ceramic Matrix Composite fiber a centerpiece of GE Aerospace\u2019s 21st century commercial and military engine\u00a0strategy SHAPING THE FUTURE OF FLIGHT GE Aerospace has a bright future and as the company that defines flight for the next generation we have not taken our eye off our mission to create a smarter and more efficient future of flight We are continuing our efforts to support use of sustainable aviation fuel or SAF which is vital to enabling the airline industry to meet its decarbonization goals The revolutionary CFM RISE Technology Demonstration Program is the manifestation of the deep commitment GE and Safran share for achieving ambitious goals for a sustainable future Leveraging an open fan architecture hybrid electric capability and key materials technologies like additive manufacturing and ceramic matrix composites CMCs this program is aiming to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by more than 20 compared with today\u2019s most efficient engines In 2022 we announced a new flight test program for a hydrogen combustion engine and an open fan flight test demonstration both with Airbus In hybrid electric we are working with NASA and Boeing to fly a megawattclass hybrid electric system And our Avio Aero team will lead a European project to test a hybrid electric motor powered by hydrogen fuel cells Overall GE Aerospace is an exceptional franchise The quality of our technology and product development plans the energy and collaboration of our team and our unique positioning as the industry\u2019s largest and youngest fleet give us confidence that this business will generate significant value for decades to come We are united by a single urgent purpose to electrify and decarbonize the planet because together we have the energy to change the world We are not only building a healthier future but living our purpose to

maintenance on a 2\u00a0MW wind turbine at Pattern\u2019s Western Spirit wind farm in New\u00a0Mexico AT THE CENTER OF A DYNAMIC AND GROWING MARKET GE Vernova sits at the center of a dynamic and growing market External catalysts including US climate legislation and constraints in the European energy market are increasing investment in new decarbonization technologies an area where GE Vernova\u2019s portfolio is uniquely positioned to lead These catalysts also improve the longterm economic profile of the underlying businesses The US Inflation Reduction Act is gamechanging It provides the certainty and stability our Renewable Energy customers need to make longterm investments especially in onshore wind GE Vernova\u2019s decarbonization technologies are aligned with the 370 billion in tax credits the bill provides Additionally the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provides at least 65 billion for investment in grid nuclear and breakthrough technologies With Europe seeking to address energy security concerns there is renewed urgency to reduce emissions and make energy more resilient and there is pragmatism in doing so The new EU taxonomy for example reinforces the important roles of gas and nuclear alongside renewables Our customers in the region are engaging our full technology roadmap including wind hydropower gas fuel blends and grid Global gas generation and utilization continues to grow with strength in Europe and the US While we saw volatility in gas prices and availability this year gas remains a fuel of choice on dispatch curves globally to meet growing electricity demand and we continue to plan for a gas turbine market of 25 to 30 gigawatts annually MAKING PROGRESS  PREPARING TO SPIN While these trends provide tailwinds for GE Vernova over time external pressures faced in 2022 impacted business performance Power delivered solid performance Gas Power grew driven by services strength and aeroderivative momentum We continued to advance our turnaround at Power Conversion focus on services at Steam Power and deliver innovation at GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy This progress enabled us to deliver doubledigit orders growth organically with growth across each business achieve highsingledigit margins with significant margin expansion and improve free cash flow of A STRONG RECORD OF\u00a0LEADERSHIP 4  NonGAAP Financial Measure  GE 2022 ANNUAL REPORT 19 billion for the year Services continues to be a major driver of our business performance and improvement and we are well positioned for continued growth with our expanded HA fleet Scott Strazik CEO of GE Vernova who successfully led the Gas Power business is now running a similar strategy at Renewable Energy Onshore Wind is an 8 billion annual revenue business where we have added over 40 gigawatts to the grid However like most of the industry this business has faced challenges due to the US production tax credit PTC lapse which reduced 2022 demand Additionally cost has been a challenge with inflation and rapid innovation straining quality We moved quickly to enhance product quality and reduce costs We deployed corrective measures in our existing fleet to increase availability reduced fixed costs which included the difficult but necessary step of decreasing our global headcount and are more selective on the projects we bid on to ensure we\u2019re executing profitably Offshore Wind is transitioning to approximately 500 million in annual revenue and growing We installed and commissioned 80 turbines for EDF on schedule and now our focus shifts to our 7gigawatt HaliadeX\u00a0backlog Grid is a 3 billion annual revenue business where market demand in automation and hardware remains strong In the fourth quarter of 2022 we saw a major inflection point\u2014Grid was profitable for the first time since 2018 reflecting our restructuring and selectivity efforts and orders also grew significantly Lean continues to generate new opportunities for sustained improvement across GE Vernova and in turn for our customers For example Gas Power Services\u2019 business playbook for planned maintenance outage events called Live Outage hosts all critical content and standard procedures that field crews need at their fingertips Initially launched in the United States at power plants powered by GE 7F gas turbines it helped complete outages safely with a substantial reduction in cycle time getting our customers\u2019 turbine back online sooner In 2022 Live Outage expanded to the Europe and the Middle East for GE 9F turbines LEADING A NEW ERA OF ENERGY The planned spinoff of GE Vernova comes as the world faces a 50 increase in electricity demand over the next two decades Against this backdrop the strategic imperative to electrify and decarbonize the world is a challenge that GE Vernova was made to meet In the US Power secured an order from Kindle Energy in Louisiana to provide HClass power generation equipment Initially fueled by natural gas it has the ability to use up to 50 hydrogen by volume In Vietnam Power secured its first new 9HA02 combinedcycle power plant order which is expected to improve the reliability and stability of the energy grid to support renewables penetration Renewable Energy along with Invenergy completed the largest wind farm in North America in a single phase Notably the Traverse Wind Energy Center is powered by more than 350 of our 2megawatt platform turbines Hydro Solutions signed orders with a total generating capacity of 7 gigawatts in 2022 and GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy is working with several customers including Ontario Power Generation in Canada to deploy advanced nuclear technologies like our BWRX300 small modular reactor which produces no carbon during operation I\u2019m excited about our plans for the future of GE Vernova Combining Renewable Energy Power and Digital into one business brings together unique experience talented people and a pioneering spirit that can power the future while also helping decarbonize the world GE HealthCare Big picture GE HealthCare operates in an attractive growing market fueled by global trends including the aging population chronic disease and the rise of the middle class in developing markets The healthcare industry is also facing challenges in improving productivity harnessing patient data more effectively and extending care out of the hospital to alternative care sites There is no medical technology company better suited to address these challenges GE HealthCare is a new company and one with extensive scale\u2014 serving 1 billion patients across 2 billion procedures a year\u2014and profound global reach with almost 60 of annual sales outside the US It also has more than 4 million equipment installations and upgrades to the fleet help the business create value and stay close to customers Investing 1 billion in research and development annually GE HealthCare remains at the forefront of innovation Geetha BP in the GE HealthCare plant in Bangalore India where high voltage amplifiers for MR subsystems tubes and generators are\u00a0made With the spin GE effectively distributed a 30 billion dividend in the form of GE HealthCare shares while retaining an approximately 199 stake in the company And shareholders in the new GE HealthCare are already seeing value unlocked as the independent company embarks on its important mission to create a world where healthcare has no limits Creating Value Today  Tomorrow GE Board Member and former US Secretary of Defense Ash Carter sadly passed away in October We miss him every day and again express our deepest sympathies to his wife and family Ash once said to me \u201cI like the ethos of GE\u201d and how GE sits on the same side of the table with customers when it comes to technology and efficient production I couldn\u2019t agree more We approach our work with our customers as \u201cone team with one fight\u201d as Ash would describe it That was as true this past year as it was for the more than 130 years that came before it and we will carry that ethos into our future 2022 marked the beginning of a new era

works We entered the year with a clear strategy for GE\u2019s path ahead and faced a world that looked quite different from what we expected We experienced inflationary pressures not seen since the 1980s geopolitical conflict global supply chain challenges and an enduring pandemic In these times we focused on \u201ccontrolling the controllable\u201d as my mentor at Danaher and GE alumnus George Sherman used to say and by doing so we advanced our plans to create independent industryleading public companies We maintained our daytoday focus of meeting customer commitments and made significant operational progress while delivering strong financial performance GE ended the year with solid revenue growth and margin expansion and 48 billion of free cash flow GE Aerospace led the way with order and revenue growth above 20 for the year and Power delivered doubledigit order growth organically and achieved highsingledigit margins And today excluding GE HealthCare highermargin and more resilient services represent an even larger part of our portfolio at approximately 60 of our revenue This was all made possible by our team\u2019s embedding lean more deeply putting our customers first and

Chemami Operations and Maintenance Specialist at Gas Power wrote to me in November of 2022 as GE marked the oneyear anniversary of the announcement of our spin plans This message stuck with me Throughout our journey over the past four years\u2014step by step\u2014we have built a stronger GE Our first priority was to reduce our debt load and we have done so by over 100 billion since 2018\u2014no small feat Often there were hard decisions to make but those choices have given us optionality to play more offense both organically and inorganically Today our balance sheet is solid and we are operating from a position of strength We are also focused on changing the way we work A lean mindset focuses on safety quality delivery and cost SQDC\u2014in that order\u2014 and gives us the tools and instincts to make the right decisions and necessary tradeoffs By deeply embedding lean principles and tools we are creating a problemsolving culture and serving our customers\u00a0better While developing a lean mindset takes many years we are gaining ground At our GE Aerospace site in Greenville South Carolina our team performs complex machining operations and detailed inspections on highpressure turbine blades With a clear focus on reducing blade delivery lead time the team created standard lines which in turn improved part flow This has reduced lead time by more than 10 days with a clear target for more reduction to come improving our operations for our customers and reducing inventory This is just one of the countless examples of effective utilization of lean across GE Our progress on these priorities has made our foundation strong enough to launch three companies More than a year after this announcement the logic behind\u2014and our conviction in\u2014our historic transformation has only strengthened Along the way the feedback from our customers investors employees and other stakeholders has been overwhelmingly positive Let\u2019s take a closer look at our businesses GE Aerospace At GE Aerospace we have a tremendously talented team a highly differentiated product and technology portfolio leading positions in attractive commercial and military sectors and a bold vision for the future of flight In 2022 nearly 3 billion people flew with our technology under wing We have nearly 41000 commercial engines1 at work in more than 70 of global airlines and a diverse portfolio of more than 26000 military engines We take that responsibility seriously living our purpose to invent the future of flight lift people up and bring them home safely A highlight in 2022 was being with the team and our customers at the Farnborough International Airshow\u2014the industry\u2019s first major gathering since the pandemic began As I looked across the tarmac and saw so many of our engines under wing I felt a deep sense of pride and appreciation\u2014for our employees who make it possible and for our customers who put their trust in us GE Aerospace\u2019s Tatum Ross is a Lead Manufacturing Engineer in Evendale Ohio seen here with a Passport engine A WINNING VALUE PROPOSITION It\u2019s now been three years since the start of the pandemic and the world is eager to travel The commercial market recovery continues and we expect total departures to return to 2019 levels in late 2023 GE Aerospace is uniquely positioned to serve this market as customers expand and upgrade their fleets Today we have new engines in each market segment that offer doubledigit fuel burn reduction lowering one of our customers\u2019 greatest variable costs In 2022 CFM International our joint venture with Safran was selected by Delta Air Lines to deliver 200 CFM LEAP1B engines to power its new fleet of Boeing 73710 aircraft with options for up to 60 additional engines We also signed an order with Qatar Airways for GE9X engines to propel up to 50 of its Boeing 7778 Freighters as well as a services agreement to cover the maintenance repair and overhaul MRO of these engines Commercial departures are a leading indicator of shop visit demand which we expect to grow by double digits in the year ahead We have a diversified services portfolio with an extensive MRO network providing us with full flexibility to meet customer needs This year both Delta TechOps and Air France Industries KLM Engineering  We invent the future of flight lift people up and bring them home safely 1 Including GE and its joint venture partners 2  GE 2022 ANNUAL REPORT WE RISE TO THE CHALLENGE OF BUILDING A WORLD THAT\u00a0WORKS Maintenance joined the global network of LEAP MRO facilities as we work to expand shop visit capacity for the rapidly growing fleet This is one of many highlights of how we are continuing to serve our\u00a0customers On the military side national defense budgets are growing In the US alone the Department of Defense increased its fiscal 2023 budget by 4 Our business is focused on winning core platforms Our groundbreaking XA100 fighter engine is the first and only adaptive cycle engine to successfully complete testing with the US Air Force confirming our ability to deliver 30 more range and twice the thermal management capability of the incumbent engine on the F35 aircraft In the face of rising geopolitical threats we stand ready to bring this innovative engine that pairs power with efficiency to the F35 fighter jet before the end of this decade In the rotorcraft segment we began testing our T901 turboshaft engine selected by the US Army to replace our ubiquitous T700 powering the Black Hawk and Apache helicopters as well as the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft And we continue to expand our international efforts with allied nations for example powering South Korea\u2019s KF21 Boramae fighter with our F414 engines DELIVERING STRONG GROWTH IN 2022 Delivering on this unprecedented ramp starts with our team The GE Aerospace leadership team balances unparalleled experience with fresh perspective with nearly half of the leaders new to their roles in the past year We see an opportunity to accelerate our lean progress both within GE Aerospace and with our partners suppliers and customers We have improved our operating rhythms moving to a more frequent weekly and monthly cadence for each of our PLs This helps us manage the business in real time and deliver better faster and more efficiently in a highly dynamic environment To help improve engine delivery for example we reprioritized 20 of our existing engineers to solve problems closer to the point of impact and quicker through daily management As a result engine output was up year over year This year we have taken steps to vertically integrate our PLs further driving focus within the portfolio For example in our Commercial Engines and Services business we are increasingly running our product lines as their own PLs aligned with how our customers work with us And we moved the Electric Power and Avionics teams to our Military business aligning PLs with a strong military customer base This granularity is improving our process capabilities especially within our supply chain and driving accountability closer to the customer Taken together lean and decentralization are making a real impact For the year revenue was up 23 organically driven by Commercial Services with internal shop visits up over 20 Margins were 183 and free cash flow was 49 billion driven by earnings and working\u00a0capital GE Aerospace lab specialist Dakota Martin inspects spools of Ceramic Matrix Composite fiber a centerpiece of GE Aerospace\u2019s 21st century commercial and military engine\u00a0strategy SHAPING THE FUTURE OF FLIGHT GE Aerospace has a bright future and as the company that defines flight for the next generation we have not taken our eye off our mission to create a smarter and more efficient future of flight We are continuing our efforts to support use of sustainable aviation fuel or SAF which is vital to enabling the airline industry to meet its decarbonization goals The revolutionary CFM RISE Technology Demonstration Program is the manifestation of the deep commitment GE and Safran share for achieving ambitious goals for a sustainable future Leveraging an open fan architecture hybrid electric capability and key materials technologies like additive manufacturing and ceramic matrix composites CMCs this program is aiming to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by more than 20 compared with today\u2019s most efficient engines In 2022 we announced a new flight test program for a hydrogen combustion engine and an open fan flight test demonstration both with Airbus In hybrid electric we are working with NASA and Boeing to fly a megawattclass hybrid electric system And our Avio Aero team will lead a European project to test a hybrid electric motor powered by hydrogen fuel cells Overall GE Aerospace is an exceptional franchise The quality of our technology and product development plans the energy and collaboration of our team and our unique positioning as the industry\u2019s largest and youngest fleet give us confidence that this business will generate significant value for decades to come We are united by a single urgent purpose to electrify and decarbonize the planet because together we have the energy to change the world We are not only building a healthier future but living our purpose to

maintenance on a 2\u00a0MW wind turbine at Pattern\u2019s Western Spirit wind farm in New\u00a0Mexico AT THE CENTER OF A DYNAMIC AND GROWING MARKET GE Vernova sits at the center of a dynamic and growing market External catalysts including US climate legislation and constraints in the European energy market are increasing investment in new decarbonization technologies an area where GE Vernova\u2019s portfolio is uniquely positioned to lead These catalysts also improve the longterm economic profile of the underlying businesses The US Inflation Reduction Act is gamechanging It provides the certainty and stability our Renewable Energy customers need to make longterm investments especially in onshore wind GE Vernova\u2019s decarbonization technologies are aligned with the 370 billion in tax credits the bill provides Additionally the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provides at least 65 billion for investment in grid nuclear and breakthrough technologies With Europe seeking to address energy security concerns there is renewed urgency to reduce emissions and make energy more resilient and there is pragmatism in doing so The new EU taxonomy for example reinforces the important roles of gas and nuclear alongside renewables Our customers in the region are engaging our full technology roadmap including wind hydropower gas fuel blends and grid Global gas generation and utilization continues to grow with strength in Europe and the US While we saw volatility in gas prices and availability this year gas remains a fuel of choice on dispatch curves globally to meet growing electricity demand and we continue to plan for a gas turbine market of 25 to 30 gigawatts annually MAKING PROGRESS  PREPARING TO SPIN While these trends provide tailwinds for GE Vernova over time external pressures faced in 2022 impacted business performance Power delivered solid performance Gas Power grew driven by services strength and aeroderivative momentum We continued to advance our turnaround at Power Conversion focus on services at Steam Power and deliver innovation at GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy This progress enabled us to deliver doubledigit orders growth organically with growth across each business achieve highsingledigit margins with significant margin expansion and improve free cash flow of A STRONG RECORD OF\u00a0LEADERSHIP 4  NonGAAP Financial Measure  GE 2022 ANNUAL REPORT 19 billion for the year Services continues to be a major driver of our business performance and improvement and we are well positioned for continued growth with our expanded HA fleet Scott Strazik CEO of GE Vernova who successfully led the Gas Power business is now running a similar strategy at Renewable Energy Onshore Wind is an 8 billion annual revenue business where we have added over 40 gigawatts to the grid However like most of the industry this business has faced challenges due to the US production tax credit PTC lapse which reduced 2022 demand Additionally cost has been a challenge with inflation and rapid innovation straining quality We moved quickly to enhance product quality and reduce costs We deployed corrective measures in our existing fleet to increase availability reduced fixed costs which included the difficult but necessary step of decreasing our global headcount and are more selective on the projects we bid on to ensure we\u2019re executing profitably Offshore Wind is transitioning to approximately 500 million in annual revenue and growing We installed and commissioned 80 turbines for EDF on schedule and now our focus shifts to our 7gigawatt HaliadeX\u00a0backlog Grid is a 3 billion annual revenue business where market demand in automation and hardware remains strong In the fourth quarter of 2022 we saw a major inflection point\u2014Grid was profitable for the first time since 2018 reflecting our restructuring and selectivity efforts and orders also grew significantly Lean continues to generate new opportunities for sustained improvement across GE Vernova and in turn for our customers For example Gas Power Services\u2019 business playbook for planned maintenance outage events called Live Outage hosts all critical content and standard procedures that field crews need at their fingertips Initially launched in the United States at power plants powered by GE 7F gas turbines it helped complete outages safely with a substantial reduction in cycle time getting our customers\u2019 turbine back online sooner In 2022 Live Outage expanded to the Europe and the Middle East for GE 9F turbines LEADING A NEW ERA OF ENERGY The planned spinoff of GE Vernova comes as the world faces a 50 increase in electricity demand over the next two decades Against this backdrop the strategic imperative to electrify and decarbonize the world is a challenge that GE Vernova was made to meet In the US Power secured an order from Kindle Energy in Louisiana to provide HClass power generation equipment Initially fueled by natural gas it has the ability to use up to 50 hydrogen by volume In Vietnam Power secured its first new 9HA02 combinedcycle power plant order which is expected to improve the reliability and stability of the energy grid to support renewables penetration Renewable Energy along with Invenergy completed the largest wind farm in North America in a single phase Notably the Traverse Wind Energy Center is powered by more than 350 of our 2megawatt platform turbines Hydro Solutions signed orders with a total generating capacity of 7 gigawatts in 2022 and GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy is working with several customers including Ontario Power Generation in Canada to deploy advanced nuclear technologies like our BWRX300 small modular reactor which produces no carbon during operation I\u2019m excited about our plans for the future of GE Vernova Combining Renewable Energy Power and Digital into one business brings together unique experience talented people and a pioneering spirit that can power the future while also helping decarbonize the world GE HealthCare Big picture GE HealthCare operates in an attractive growing market fueled by global trends including the aging population chronic disease and the rise of the middle class in developing markets The healthcare industry is also facing challenges in improving productivity harnessing patient data more effectively and extending care out of the hospital to alternative care sites There is no medical technology company better suited to address these challenges GE HealthCare is a new company and one with extensive scale\u2014 serving 1 billion patients across 2 billion procedures a year\u2014and profound global reach with almost 60 of annual sales outside the US It also has more than 4 million equipment installations and upgrades to the fleet help the business create value and stay close to customers Investing 1 billion in research and development annually GE HealthCare remains at the forefront of innovation Geetha BP in the GE HealthCare plant in Bangalore India where high voltage amplifiers for MR subsystems tubes and generators are\u00a0made With the spin GE effectively distributed a 30 billion dividend in the form of GE HealthCare shares while retaining an approximately 199 stake in the company And shareholders in the new GE HealthCare are already seeing value unlocked as the independent company embarks on its important mission to create a world where healthcare has no limits Creating Value Today  Tomorrow GE Board Member and former US Secretary of Defense Ash Carter sadly passed away in October We miss him every day and again express our deepest sympathies to his wife and family Ash once said to me \u201cI like the ethos of GE\u201d and how GE sits on the same side of the table with customers when it comes to technology and efficient production I couldn\u2019t agree more We approach our work with our customers as \u201cone team with one fight\u201d as Ash would describe it That was as true this past year as it was for the more than 130 years that came before it and we will carry that ethos into our future 2022 marked the beginning of a new era

Back then our leadership team and I laid out a comprehensive strategy to strengthen and grow the firm First we would invest in our core businesses Second we would pursue four growth initiatives asset management wealth management transaction banking and consumer banking And third we would run the firm more efficiently In addition for the first time we set public firmwide financial targets to help investors hold us accountable In February 2023 we took another step on our journey when we held our second Investor Day and as I said then it has certainly been an interesting three years Back in January 2020 nobody would have imagined that just a few weeks later a pandemic would break out and there would be such disruption in the global economy Even today we\u2019re operating in an uncertain environment The war in Ukraine has roiled energy markets and an increase in inflation has triggered monetary tightening But through it all we\u2019ve stayed focused on shareholders and I\u2019m proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished Since our first Investor Day our total shareholder return is 60 percent outperforming our peer average meaningfully1 Our book value per share is up by nearly 40 percent roughly twice that of our closest competitor1 Our earnings per share is up by over 40 percent We\u2019ve returned nearly 18 billion in capital to common shareholders And our average returns over the past three years are in line with ANNUAL REPORT 2022 LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS John Waldron President and Chief Operating Officer David Solomon Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Denis Coleman Chief Financial Officer 3 \u201cBeing exceptional is not a given but we always learn and adapt\u201d our current targets of 14\u201316 percent return on equity ROE and 15\u201317 percent return on tangible equity ROTE2 When you look at our 2022 results specifically there\u2019s no question that the operating environment was challenging The same business mix that did so well in 2021 faced headwinds such as low capital markets issuance activity and falling equity and fixed income asset prices At the same time we continued to make strategic investments in our acquisitions and technology that though important to the firm\u2019s longterm strength weighed on our financial performance in the short run Despite those difficulties we delivered for shareholders in 2022 Net revenues were 474 billion net earnings were 113 billion and diluted earnings per common share were 3006 ROE was 102 percent and ROTE2 was 110 percent We also grew our book value per share by 67 percent and continued to make significant progress on our strategic evolution As a result in a macro environment where equity issuance hit a nearly twodecade low we performed better than we would have three years ago In the pages that follow we lay out in detail the state of our franchise as well as the progress we\u2019ve made in our businesses and as you\u2019ll see our strategy is a reflection of our purpose We aspire to be the world\u2019s most exceptional financial institution united by our core values of partnership client service integrity and excellence Being exceptional is not a given but we always learn and adapt We are constantly focused on outperforming for our clients And what\u2019s most exceptional about our firm is our people As I travel around the world meeting with clients I\u2019m often told how

colleagues I\u2019m also fortunate to work with a leadership team that is laserfocused on executing our strategy our president and chief operating officer John Waldron our chief financial officer Denis Coleman and our entire Management Committee The path ahead is never certain and there will be plenty of challenges along the way but we head into 2023 energized excited and determined to deliver for shareholders One Goldman Sachs At the heart of our strategy is a focus on clients We believe that serving our clients exceptionally well will both strengthen our franchise and deliver returns for our shareholders As a result in 2019 we started a pilot program that we believed would help demonstrate that commitment One Goldman Sachs One Goldman Sachs is now the organizational philosophy that underpins how we cover our clients in an increasingly complex world It puts clients at the center of everything we do It brings to bear our intellectual capital and expertise across all our businesses to serve our global client franchise in a more integrated and comprehensive manner Today we have partners who are responsible for owning the entire firmwide relationship with One Goldman Sachs clients and as part of that they are responsible for building dedicated teams that bring together the relevant experts and thought leaders across the firm to serve the client One Goldman Sachs is highly accretive to multiple parts of our business and more importantly it\u2019s highly accretive to our clients who get the best of Goldman Sachs One Goldman Sachs has expanded beyond a pilot program We believe this ethos is applicable and extensible to a much broader set of clients Strategic Reorganization In December 2022 building off our renewed commitment to client centricity we reorganized the firm into three segments 1 Global Banking  Markets 2 Asset  Wealth Management and 3 Platform Solutions into which we have integrated two lines of businesses Transaction banking and Consumer platforms which consists of our consumer card partnerships and GreenSky We saw this as the logical next step in our strategic journey to building a more durable firm that generates higher returns through the cycle We are now reporting our results under our new structure and we have also announced three key execution priorities 1 maximizing wallet share and growing financing activities in GBM 2 growing management and other fees in AWM and 3 scaling Platform Solutions to deliver profitability We believe we\u2019re now well positioned to execute our strategy capitalize on our strengths and achieve our execution priorities in all three of our segments 1 2 3 Maximizing wallet share and growing financing activities in Global Banking  Markets Growing management and other fees in Asset  Wealth Management Scaling Platform Solutions to deliver profitability Our Three Key Execution Priorities ANNUAL REPORT 2022 LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS Asset  Wealth Management In Asset  Wealth Management we\u2019ve taken several disparate businesses inside the firm and combined them into one powerful platform Today we are a top 5 global active asset manager6 and a top 5 global alternatives manager6 with a premier wealth management franchise We now have more than 25 trillion in assets under supervision AUS We had a record year in alternatives fundraising in 2022 with 72 billion raised across our franchise Overall we\u2019ve raised nearly 180 billion since 2019 making real progress toward our revised target of 225 billion Of that 72 billion in alternatives 27 billion came through our wealth platform And we now have loan penetration7 with approximately 30 percent of our US private wealth clients leaving us plenty of room for growth Our total client assets8 in Wealth management stand at more than 1 trillion In 2022 our Asset  Wealth Management business generated net revenues of 134 billion a 39 percent decline from 2021 A steep drop in the net revenues related to Equity and Debt investments offset an additional 1 billion of Management and other fees and a strong increase in Private banking and lending net revenues Fullyear Management and other fees were 88 billion putting us well on track to hit our 2024 target of more than 10 billion Platform Solutions In 2022 we decided to significantly narrow our ambitions for our consumer strategy Now we have a smaller set of emerging businesses We are working to drive them to profitability and we\u2019re also considering strategic alternatives for our Consumer platforms Segment Performance Global Banking  Markets Global Banking  Markets is an extraordinary franchise We\u2019ve been 1 in global completed MA for 23 of the last 24 years3 and once again this year we were the advisor of choice We were also 2 in equity and equityrelated underwriting as well as in highyield debt underwriting And yet over the past three years we\u2019ve seen significant growth We\u2019ve increased wallet share by 370 basis points4 We\u2019ve increased our financing activities in FICC and Equities at a 16 percent compound annual growth rate CAGR to more than 7 billion in net revenues for 2022 And we\u2019re now ranked in the top 3 with 77 of the top 100 institutional clients across FICC and Equities up from a base of 51 at our first Investor Day5 We had a very good business and we\u2019ve made it better In 2022 GBM generated revenues of 325 billion a 12 percent decline from 2021 as significantly higher FICC net revenues were more than offset by a steep decline in Investment banking fees Advisory net revenues however were 47 billion the second highest in our history 7 ANNUAL REPORT 2022 LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS Firmwide Expenses Total operating expenses for the year were 312 billion down by 2 percent from 2021 Compensation and benefits expenses fell by 15 percent despite a 10 percent increase in headcount and were largely offset by higher noncompensation expenses The increase in noncompensation expenses was primarily related to acquisitions transactionbased costs and continued investments in technology In addition clientrelated market development costs were higher following lower levels during the pandemic We remain highly focused on operating efficiency We are actively engaged in expense mitigation efforts as we look to appropriately calibrate the firm for the operating environment Balance Sheet Our balance sheet ended the year at 14 trillion down by 114 billion versus the third quarter and relatively flat year over year as we focused on actively managing our resources Deposits ended the year at 387 billion up by approximately 23 billion year over year reflecting growth in private bank and consumer deposits and transaction banking deposits At the end of the fourth quarter our standardized CET1 ratio was 150 percent up by 80 basis points year over year This represents a 120basispoint buffer to our new capital requirement of 138 percent in the beginning of 2023 We returned 67 billion to common shareholders including common stock repurchases of 35 billion and common stock dividends of 32 billion Focused on the Forward We believe our strategy positions us well to meet our financial targets through the cycle And while in tougher environments we may not hit our return targets our actions over the past several years have raised the floor of our returns while retaining the upside in more conducive markets and lowering the overall volatility Across all our businesses we are focused on the forward The integration of our 1 Investment Banking franchise9 with our leading FICC and Equities businesses positions Global Banking  Markets to continue delivering strong returns Now we are focused on capturing share particularly in favorable environments while maintaining resource discipline The size breadth and diversity of our mix of activities have made revenues relatively stable over time Our share gains and higher financing revenues over the past few years have further increased durability This is a great business and we are performing for clients at the highest level In Asset  Wealth Management our franchise benefits from the Goldman Sachs ecosystem that gives clients access to a wide breadth of products and solutions as well as our unique market insight and expertise We\u2019re focused on investment performance and client experience to drive a more durable revenue stream from fees and Private banking and lending We are keeping ourselves accountable with our new mediumterm targets on revenue growth margin and ROE This is the 9 area where there is the most significant growth opportunity for us and where we are already operating at scale And in Platform Solutions though this segment remains small in the context of the broader firm we see potential in these emerging platforms We believe these are attractive businesses that provide stable more recurring revenue derived from net interest income and fees and we offer innovative techforward products for our end customers Firmwide we remain committed to delivering on our financial targets and we are confident in our ability to do so given the underlying strength of our franchise In the past three years our average ROE was 148 percent This was in line with our targets and 320 basis points higher than the peer10 average And if you exclude the impact of litigation in 2020 our average ROE would have been roughly 130 basis points higher As we look ahead we are committed to making the firm more transparent and accountable to shareholders This is just as important to us as our business level targets We\u2019ve made a conscious effort to be open and accessible with enhanced disclosures more frequent investor conferences and regular strategic updates We\u2019ve continued to lay out targets for our firm and our businesses and we\u2019ve provided robust disclosure of key performance indicators to measure our progress We\u2019ve also made important changes to better align employee incentives All our Management Committee members receive 100 percent of their annual stockbased compensation in performancebased shares that are earned based on future results This is intended specifically to enhance collaboration and align our entire leadership team with longterm shareholder value creation Beyond that many of our employees are shareholders as well We are united in driving shareholder value Our People In addition to serving our clients and delivering for shareholders we\u2019re also focused on taking care of our people We have a longstanding commitment to recruiting developing and promoting the best talent available with the widest range of backgrounds experiences and perspectives We have made headway with our diverse representation goals at the analyst associate and vice president levels We were proud that our 2022 partner class was the most diverse to date That said we still have much work to do to build and retain a pipeline of diverse leadership We returned 67 billion to common shareholders common stock dividends common stock repurchases 32B 35B ANNUAL REPORT 2022 LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS 11 \u201cThe path ahead is never certain and there will be plenty of challenges along the way but we head into 2023 energized excited and determined to deliver for shareholders\u201d David Solomon 11 ANNUAL REPORT 2022 LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS Community Engagement We\u2019re also continuing our long tradition of investing in our communities In 2023 we mark the 15th anniversary of Goldman Sachs 10000 Women our ongoing initiative to foster economic growth by providing women entrepreneurs around the world with a business and management education and access to capital The 10000 Women inperson business education program was launched in 2008 and in 2018 the curriculum was made available online through Coursera further democratizing access In 2014 in partnership with the International Finance Corporation IFC 10000 Women launched a firstofitskind global finance facility the Women Entrepreneurs Opportunity Facility to enable access to capital for more women entrepreneurs As of March 2023 the facility had reached more than 164000 women entrepreneurs eclipsing the 100000 target set when the initiative was launched and contributing to an over 45 billion increase in the volume of loans onlent by financial institutions to womenowned businesses Overall Goldman Sachs 10000 Women has reached more than 200000 women from over 150 countries Building on what we learned from 10000 Women in 2009 we launched our signature entrepreneurship initiative Goldman Sachs 10000 Small Businesses Today the program has served more than 13600 small businesses in all 50 states through our education program and it has also partnered with select Community Development Financial Institutions to provide loans to small businesses In 2020 we launched a new advocacy initiative Goldman Sachs 10000 Small Business Voices to help small business owners in the US advocate for policy changes that matter to them In July 2022 we brought together more than 2500 entrepreneurs at our summit in Washington DC \u2014 the largest gathering of its kind \u2014 to hear from top business leaders devise new strategies for business growth and meet with more than 300 members of Congress to call for policy action specifically to modernize and reauthorize the Small Business Administration for the first time in more than 20 years In 2021 we took what we had learned from both programs to launch our latest initiative One Million Black Women In the first two years we\u2019ve already seen progress and firmwide engagement We\u2019ve committed more than 1 billion of investment capital and more than 20 million in grant capital to 116 organizations companies and projects which puts us on track to directly impact the lives of more than 184000 Black women and girls Some examples include a growth equity investment in CareAcademy a Black woman\u2013led upskilling company our Alternative Investment Management Black Equity Opportunities fund and our people serving as executive coaches to Black women school principals through our partnership with New Leaders From our experience and with the guidance of our Advisory Council we\u2019ve learned that what we need most \u2014 more than good ideas \u2014 are partners Only by combining our efforts can we hope to transform the economy we leave behind for the next generation Sustainable Finance Another area where we\u2019ve long been focused is sustainability We have been a leading voice in the financial services industry addressing climate change and other critical environmental challenges going back to 2005 when we established our Environmental Policy Framework In 2019 we set a target of 750 billion in financing advisory and investing activity over the next 10 years across the themes of climate transition and inclusive growth We have achieved approximately 55 percent of our target in three years By connecting our experience as a financial institution with the insights gained through our work with clients and partners and our ongoing engagement with the public sector we are enabling capital to move toward solutions that will help clients not only adapt but also take ownership to drive the transition to a lowcarbon economy At the same time we cannot address market gaps at scale on our own so we continue to identify strategic partners whose strengths and areas of focus complement our own 13 ANNUAL REPORT 2022 LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS David Solomon Chairman and Chief Executive Officer The Path Ahead When you look at our strategy our culture our talent and our track record I think we\u2019re incredibly well positioned to serve our clients We are stewards of their trust \u2014 a trust that has been built up over a very long period of time Goldman Sachs has a deep history of working with clients who have had a huge impact on the world and we work hard to uphold that tradition of exceptional client service every day As we go forward we are focused on the success of our clients and our franchise so we can deliver for shareholders We\u2019re working hard to raise the floor on returns and achieve our throughthecycle targets Our leadership is focused on our key priorities to make the firm stronger and more diversified And I believe if we

for shareholders One Goldman Sachs At the heart of our strategy is a focus on clients We believe that serving our clients exceptionally well will both strengthen our franchise and deliver returns for our shareholders As a result in 2019 we started a pilot program that we believed would help demonstrate that commitment One Goldman Sachs One Goldman Sachs is now the organizational philosophy that underpins how we cover our clients in an increasingly complex world It puts clients at the center of everything we do It brings to bear our intellectual capital and expertise across all our businesses to serve our global client franchise in a more integrated and comprehensive manner Today we have partners who are responsible for owning the entire firmwide relationship with One Goldman Sachs clients

accretive to multiple parts of our business and more importantly it\u2019s highly accretive to our clients who get the best of Goldman Sachs One Goldman Sachs has expanded beyond a pilot program We believe this ethos is applicable and extensible to a much broader set of clients Strategic Reorganization In December 2022 building off our renewed commitment to client centricity we reorganized the firm into three segments 1 Global Banking  Markets 2 Asset  Wealth Management and 3 Platform Solutions into which we have integrated two lines of businesses Transaction banking and Consumer platforms which consists of our consumer card partnerships and GreenSky We saw this as the logical next step in our strategic journey to building a more durable firm that generates higher returns through the cycle We are now reporting our results under our new structure and we have also announced three key execution priorities 1 maximizing wallet share and growing financing activities in GBM 2 growing management and other fees in AWM and 3 scaling Platform Solutions to deliver profitability We believe we\u2019re now well positioned to execute our strategy capitalize on our strengths and achieve our execution priorities in all three of our segments 1 2 3 Maximizing wallet share and growing financing activities in Global Banking  Markets Growing management and other fees in Asset  Wealth Management Scaling Platform Solutions to deliver profitability Our Three Key Execution Priorities ANNUAL REPORT 2022 LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS Asset  Wealth Management In Asset  Wealth Management we\u2019ve taken several disparate businesses inside the firm and combined them into one powerful platform Today we are a top 5 global active asset manager6 and a top 5 global alternatives manager6 with a premier wealth management franchise We now have more than 25 trillion in assets under supervision AUS We had a record year in alternatives fundraising in 2022 with 72 billion raised across our franchise Overall we\u2019ve raised nearly 180 billion since 2019 making real progress toward our revised target of 225 billion Of that 72 billion in alternatives 27 billion came through our wealth platform And we now have loan penetration7 with approximately 30 percent of our US private wealth clients leaving us plenty of room for growth Our total client assets8 in Wealth management stand at more than 1 trillion In 2022 our Asset  Wealth Management business generated net revenues of 134 billion a 39 percent decline from 2021 A steep drop in the net revenues related to Equity and Debt investments offset an additional 1 billion of Management and other fees and a strong increase in Private banking and lending net revenues Fullyear Management and other fees were 88 billion putting us well on track to hit our 2024 target of more than 10 billion Platform Solutions In 2022 we decided to significantly narrow our ambitions for our consumer strategy Now we have a smaller set of emerging businesses We are working to drive them to profitability and we\u2019re also considering strategic alternatives for our Consumer platforms Segment Performance Global Banking  Markets Global Banking  Markets is an extraordinary franchise We\u2019ve been 1 in global completed MA for 23 of the last 24 years3 and once again this year we were the advisor of choice We were also 2 in equity and equityrelated underwriting as well as in highyield debt underwriting And yet over the past three years we\u2019ve seen significant growth We\u2019ve increased wallet share by 370 basis points4 We\u2019ve increased our financing activities in FICC and Equities at a 16 percent compound annual growth rate CAGR to more than 7 billion in net revenues for 2022 And we\u2019re now ranked in the top 3 with 77 of the top 100 institutional clients across FICC and Equities up from a base of 51 at our first Investor Day5 We had a very good business and we\u2019ve made it better In 2022 GBM generated revenues of 325 billion a 12 percent decline from 2021 as significantly higher FICC net revenues were more than offset by a steep decline in Investment banking fees Advisory net revenues however were 47 billion the second highest in our history 7 ANNUAL REPORT 2022 LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS Firmwide Expenses Total operating expenses for the year were 312 billion down by 2 percent from 2021 Compensation and benefits expenses fell by 15 percent despite a 10 percent increase in headcount and were largely offset by higher noncompensation expenses The increase in noncompensation expenses was primarily related to acquisitions transactionbased costs and continued investments in technology In addition clientrelated market development costs were higher following lower levels during the pandemic We remain highly focused on operating efficiency We are actively engaged in expense mitigation efforts as we look to appropriately calibrate the firm for the operating environment Balance Sheet Our balance sheet ended the year at 14 trillion down by 114 billion versus the third quarter and relatively flat year over year as we focused on actively managing our resources Deposits ended the year at 387 billion up by approximately 23 billion year over year reflecting growth in private bank and consumer deposits and transaction banking deposits At the end of the fourth quarter our standardized CET1 ratio was 150 percent up by 80 basis points year over year This represents a 120basispoint buffer to our new capital requirement of 138 percent in the beginning of 2023 We returned 67 billion to common shareholders including common stock repurchases of 35 billion and common stock dividends of 32 billion Focused on the Forward We believe our strategy positions us well to meet our financial targets through the cycle And while in tougher environments we may not hit our return targets our actions over the past several years have raised the floor of our returns while retaining the upside in more conducive markets and lowering the overall volatility Across all our businesses we are focused on the forward The integration of our 1 Investment Banking franchise9 with our leading FICC and Equities businesses positions Global Banking  Markets to continue delivering strong returns Now we are focused on capturing share particularly in favorable environments while maintaining resource discipline The size breadth and diversity of our mix of activities have made revenues relatively stable over time Our share gains and higher financing revenues over the past few years have further increased durability This is a great business and we are performing for clients at the highest level In Asset  Wealth Management our franchise benefits from the Goldman Sachs ecosystem that gives clients access to a wide breadth of products and solutions as well as our unique market insight and expertise We\u2019re focused on investment performance and client experience to drive a more durable revenue stream from fees and Private banking and lending We are keeping ourselves accountable with our new mediumterm targets on revenue growth margin and ROE This is the 9 area where there is the most significant growth opportunity for us and where we are already operating at scale And in Platform Solutions though this segment remains small in the context of the broader firm we see potential in these emerging platforms We believe these are attractive businesses that provide stable more recurring revenue derived from net interest income and fees and we offer innovative techforward products for our end customers Firmwide we remain committed to delivering on our financial targets and we are confident in our ability to do so given the underlying strength of our franchise In the past three years our average ROE was 148 percent This was in line with our targets and 320 basis points higher than the peer10 average And if you exclude the impact of litigation in 2020 our average ROE would have been roughly 130 basis points higher As we look ahead we are committed to making the firm more transparent and accountable to shareholders This is just as important to us as our business level targets We\u2019ve made a conscious effort to be open and accessible with enhanced disclosures more frequent investor conferences and regular strategic updates We\u2019ve continued to lay out targets for our firm and our businesses and we\u2019ve provided robust disclosure of key performance indicators to measure our progress We\u2019ve also made important changes to better align employee incentives All our Management Committee members receive 100 percent of their annual stockbased compensation in performancebased shares that are earned based on future results This is intended specifically to enhance collaboration and align our entire leadership team with longterm shareholder value creation Beyond that many of our employees are shareholders as well We are united in driving shareholder value Our People In addition to serving our clients and delivering for shareholders we\u2019re also focused on taking care of our people We have a longstanding commitment to recruiting developing and promoting the best talent available with the widest range of backgrounds experiences and perspectives We have made headway with our diverse representation goals at the analyst associate and vice president levels We were proud that our 2022 partner class was the most diverse to date That said we still have much work to do to build and retain a pipeline of diverse

Community Engagement We\u2019re also continuing our long tradition of investing in our communities In 2023 we mark the 15th anniversary of Goldman Sachs 10000 Women our ongoing initiative to foster economic growth by providing women entrepreneurs around the world with a business and management education and access to capital The 10000 Women inperson business education program was launched in 2008 and in 2018 the curriculum was made available online through Coursera further democratizing access In 2014 in partnership with the International Finance Corporation IFC 10000 Women launched a firstofitskind global finance facility the Women Entrepreneurs Opportunity Facility to enable access to capital for more women entrepreneurs As of March 2023 the facility had reached more than 164000 women entrepreneurs eclipsing the 100000 target set when the initiative was launched and contributing to an over 45 billion increase in the volume of loans onlent by financial institutions to womenowned businesses Overall Goldman Sachs 10000 Women has reached more than 200000 women from over 150 countries Building on what we learned from 10000 Women in 2009 we launched our signature entrepreneurship initiative Goldman Sachs 10000 Small Businesses Today the program has served more than 13600 small businesses in all 50 states through our education program and it has also partnered with select Community Development Financial Institutions to provide loans to small businesses In 2020 we launched a new advocacy initiative Goldman Sachs 10000 Small Business Voices to help small business owners in the US advocate for policy changes that matter to them In July 2022 we brought together more than 2500 entrepreneurs at our summit in Washington DC \u2014 the largest gathering of its kind \u2014 to hear from top business leaders devise new strategies for business growth and meet with more than 300 members of Congress to call for policy action specifically to modernize and reauthorize the Small Business Administration for the first time in more than 20 years In 2021 we took what we had learned from both programs to launch our latest initiative One Million Black Women In the first two years we\u2019ve already seen progress and firmwide engagement We\u2019ve committed more than 1 billion of investment capital and more than 20 million in grant capital to 116 organizations companies and projects which puts us on track to directly impact the lives of more than 184000 Black women and girls Some examples include a growth equity investment in CareAcademy a Black woman\u2013led upskilling company our Alternative Investment Management Black Equity Opportunities fund and our people serving as executive coaches to Black women school principals through our partnership with New Leaders From our experience and with the guidance of our Advisory Council we\u2019ve learned that what we need most \u2014 more than good ideas \u2014 are partners Only by combining our efforts can we hope to transform the economy we leave behind for the next generation Sustainable Finance Another area where we\u2019ve long been focused is sustainability We have been a leading voice in the financial services industry addressing climate change and other critical environmental challenges going back to 2005 when we established our Environmental Policy Framework In 2019 we set a target of 750 billion in financing advisory and investing activity over the next 10 years across the themes of climate transition and inclusive growth We have achieved approximately 55 percent of our target in three years By connecting our experience as a financial institution with the insights gained through our work with clients and partners and our ongoing engagement with the public sector we are enabling capital to move toward solutions that will help clients not only adapt but also take ownership to drive the transition to a lowcarbon economy At the same time we cannot address market gaps at scale on our own so we continue to identify strategic partners whose strengths and areas of focus complement our own 13 ANNUAL REPORT 2022 LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS David Solomon

management wealth management transaction banking and consumer banking And third we would run the firm more efficiently In addition for the first time we set public firmwide financial targets to help

January 2020 nobody would have imagined that just a few weeks later a pandemic would break out and there would be such disruption in the global economy Even today we\u2019re operating in an uncertain

economic growth by providing women entrepreneurs around the world with a business and management education and access to capital The 10000 Women inperson business education program was launched in 2008 and in 2018 the curriculum was made available online through Coursera further democratizing access In 2014 in partnership with the International Finance Corporation IFC 10000 Women launched a firstofitskind global finance facility the Women Entrepreneurs Opportunity Facility to enable access to capital for more women entrepreneurs As of March 2023 the facility had reached more than 164000 women entrepreneurs eclipsing the 100000 target set when the initiative was launched and contributing to an over 45 billion increase in the volume of loans onlent by financial institutions to

entrepreneurship initiative Goldman Sachs 10000 Small Businesses Today the program has served more than 13600 small businesses in all 50 states through our education program and it has also partnered with select Community Development Financial Institutions to provide loans to small businesses In 2020 we launched a new advocacy initiative Goldman Sachs 10000 Small Business Voices to help small business owners in the US advocate for policy changes that matter to them In July 2022 we brought together more than 2500 entrepreneurs at our summit in Washington DC \u2014 the largest gathering of

combining our efforts can we hope to transform the economy we leave behind for the next generation Sustainable Finance Another area where we\u2019ve long been focused is sustainability We have been a leading voice in the financial services industry addressing climate change and other critical environmental challenges going back to 2005 when we established our Environmental Policy Framework In 2019 we set a target of 750 billion in financing advisory and investing activity over the next 10 years across the themes of climate transition and inclusive growth We have achieved approximately 55 percent of our target in three years By connecting our experience as a financial institution with the insights gained through our work with clients and partners and our ongoing engagement with the public sector we are enabling capital to move toward solutions that will help clients not only adapt but also take ownership to drive the transition to a lowcarbon economy At the same time we cannot address market gaps at scale on our own so we continue to identify strategic partners whose strengths and areas of focus complement our own 13 ANNUAL REPORT 2022 LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS David Solomon

Back then our leadership team and I laid out a comprehensive strategy to strengthen and grow the firm First we would invest in our core businesses Second we would pursue four growth initiatives asset management wealth management transaction banking and consumer banking And third we would run the firm more efficiently In addition for the first time we set public firmwide financial targets to help investors hold us accountable In February 2023 we took another step on our journey when we held our second Investor Day and as I said then it has certainly been an interesting three years Back in January 2020 nobody would have imagined that just a few weeks later a pandemic would break out and there would be such disruption in the global economy Even today we\u2019re operating in an uncertain environment The war in Ukraine has roiled energy markets and an increase in inflation has triggered monetary tightening But through it all we\u2019ve stayed focused on shareholders and I\u2019m proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished Since our first Investor Day our total shareholder return is 60 percent outperforming our peer average meaningfully1 Our book value per share is up by nearly 40 percent

as low capital markets issuance activity and falling equity and fixed income asset prices At the same time we continued to make strategic investments in our acquisitions and technology that though important to the firm\u2019s longterm strength weighed on our financial performance in the short run Despite those difficulties we delivered for shareholders in 2022 Net revenues were 474 billion net earnings were 113 billion and diluted earnings per common share were 3006 ROE was 102 percent and ROTE2 was 110 percent We also grew our book value per share by 67 percent and continued to make significant progress on our strategic evolution As a result in a macro environment where equity issuance hit a nearly twodecade low we performed better than we would have three years ago In the pages

Denis Coleman and our entire Management Committee The path ahead is never certain and there will be plenty of challenges along the way but we head into 2023 energized excited and determined to deliver for shareholders One Goldman Sachs At the heart of our strategy is a focus on clients We believe that serving our clients exceptionally well will both strengthen our franchise and deliver returns for our shareholders As a result in 2019 we started a pilot program that we believed would help demonstrate that commitment One Goldman Sachs One Goldman Sachs is now the organizational philosophy that underpins how we cover our clients in an increasingly complex world It puts clients at the center of everything we do It brings to bear our intellectual capital and expertise across all our businesses to serve our global client franchise in a more integrated and comprehensive manner Today we have partners who are responsible for owning the entire firmwide relationship with One Goldman Sachs clients and as part of that they are responsible for building dedicated teams that bring together the relevant experts and thought leaders across the firm to serve the client One Goldman Sachs is highly accretive to multiple parts of our business and more importantly it\u2019s highly accretive to our clients who get the best of Goldman Sachs One Goldman Sachs has expanded beyond a pilot program We believe this ethos is applicable and extensible to a much broader set of clients Strategic Reorganization In December 2022 building off our renewed commitment to client centricity we reorganized the firm into three segments 1 Global Banking  Markets 2 Asset  Wealth Management and 3 Platform Solutions into which we have integrated two lines of businesses Transaction banking and Consumer platforms which consists of our consumer card partnerships and GreenSky We saw this as the logical next step in our strategic journey to building a more durable firm that generates higher returns through the cycle We are now reporting our results under our new structure and we have also announced three key execution priorities 1 maximizing wallet share and growing financing activities in GBM 2 growing management and other fees in AWM and 3 scaling Platform Solutions to deliver profitability We believe we\u2019re now well positioned to execute our strategy capitalize on our strengths and achieve our execution priorities in all three of our segments 1 2 3 Maximizing wallet share and growing financing activities in Global Banking  Markets Growing management and other fees in Asset  Wealth Management Scaling Platform Solutions to deliver profitability Our Three Key Execution Priorities ANNUAL REPORT 2022 LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS Asset  Wealth Management In Asset  Wealth Management we\u2019ve taken several disparate businesses inside the firm and combined them into one powerful platform Today we are a top 5 global active asset manager6 and a top 5 global alternatives manager6 with a premier wealth management franchise We now have more than 25 trillion in assets under supervision AUS We had a record year in alternatives fundraising in 2022 with 72 billion raised across our franchise Overall we\u2019ve raised nearly 180 billion since 2019 making real progress toward our revised target of 225 billion Of that 72 billion in alternatives 27 billion came through our wealth platform And we now have loan penetration7 with approximately 30 percent of our US private wealth clients leaving us plenty of room for growth Our total client assets8 in Wealth management stand at more than 1 trillion In 2022 our Asset  Wealth Management business generated net revenues of 134 billion a 39 percent decline from 2021 A steep drop in the net revenues related to Equity and Debt investments offset an additional 1 billion of Management and other fees and a strong increase in Private banking and lending net revenues Fullyear Management and other fees were 88 billion putting us well on track to hit our 2024 target of more than 10 billion Platform Solutions In 2022 we decided to significantly narrow our ambitions for our consumer strategy Now we have a smaller set of emerging businesses We are working to drive them to profitability and we\u2019re also considering strategic alternatives for our Consumer platforms Segment Performance Global Banking  Markets Global Banking  Markets is an extraordinary franchise We\u2019ve been 1 in global completed MA for 23 of the last 24 years3 and once again this year we were the advisor of choice We were also 2 in equity and equityrelated underwriting as well as in highyield debt underwriting And yet over the past three years we\u2019ve seen significant growth We\u2019ve increased wallet share by 370 basis points4 We\u2019ve increased our financing activities in FICC and Equities at a 16 percent compound annual growth rate CAGR to more than 7 billion in net revenues for 2022 And we\u2019re now ranked in the top 3 with 77 of the top 100 institutional clients across FICC and Equities up from a base of 51 at our first Investor Day5 We had a very good business and we\u2019ve made it better In 2022 GBM generated revenues of 325 billion a 12 percent decline from 2021 as significantly higher FICC net revenues were more than offset by a steep decline in Investment banking fees Advisory net revenues however were 47 billion the second highest in our history 7 ANNUAL REPORT 2022 LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS Firmwide Expenses Total operating expenses for the year were 312 billion down by 2 percent from 2021 Compensation and benefits expenses fell by 15 percent despite a 10 percent increase in headcount and were largely offset by higher noncompensation expenses The increase in noncompensation expenses was primarily related to acquisitions transactionbased costs and continued investments in technology In addition clientrelated market development costs were higher following lower levels during the pandemic We remain highly focused on operating efficiency We are actively engaged in expense mitigation efforts as we look to appropriately calibrate the firm for the operating environment Balance Sheet Our balance sheet ended the year at 14 trillion down by 114 billion versus the third quarter and relatively flat year over year as we focused on actively managing our resources Deposits ended the year at 387 billion up by approximately 23 billion year over year reflecting growth in private bank and consumer deposits and transaction banking deposits At the end of the fourth quarter our standardized CET1 ratio was 150 percent up by 80 basis points year over year This represents a 120basispoint buffer to our new capital requirement of 138 percent in the beginning of 2023 We returned 67 billion to common shareholders including common stock repurchases of 35 billion and common stock dividends of 32 billion Focused on the Forward We believe our strategy positions us well to meet our

we set a target of 750 billion in financing advisory and investing activity over the next 10 years across the themes of climate transition and inclusive growth We have achieved approximately 55 percent of our target in three years By connecting our experience as a financial institution with the insights gained through our work with clients and partners and our ongoing engagement with the public sector we are enabling capital to move toward solutions that will help clients not only adapt but also take ownership to drive the transition to a lowcarbon economy At the same time we cannot address market gaps at scale on our own so we continue to identify strategic partners whose strengths and areas of focus complement our own 13 ANNUAL REPORT 2022 LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS David Solomon

671 billion and adjusted earnings per share of 478 driven by the commercial air traffic rebound We spent more than 9 billion on research and development and capital expenditures in 2022 as we continue to invest in technology and innovation and fund future organic growth We generated 72 billion in cash flow from operations and ended the year with 49\u00a0billion in free cash flow despite a 16 billion additional US federal cash tax payment associated with the amortization of RD spending for federal tax purposes We continue to reduce costs achieving over 400 million in mergerrelated gross cost synergies These bring our total synergies to about 14 billion since the merger and we are on track to meet our target of 15 billion a year earlier than planned We also returned 59 billion to shareowners in 2022 through dividends and share repurchases bringing our capital return mergertodate to 133 billion Continued progress Sustainable aviation Raytheon Technologies\u2019 commitment to sustainable air travel continues to advance In October Airbus began development flight testing of the Pratt  Whitney GTF Advantage engine on an A320neo aircraft The GTF Advantage is the world\u2019s most efficient and sustainable singleaisle aircraft engine and last year it also proved capable of running on 100 percent sustainable aviation fuel Since entering service in 2016 GTF engines have saved more than one billion gallons of jet fuel and more than 10 million metric tons of CO2 Our leadership in sustainability was also evident in NASA\u2019s selection of Pratt\u00a0\u00a0Whitney to develop advanced engine technologies to reduce fuel consumption and emissions for the next singleaisle aircraft Meanwhile the European Union Commission selected Collins Aerospace and Pratt  Whitney via the Clean Aviation Joint Undertaking to team with EU and UK partners on seven sustainable aviation development projects ranging from hybrid electric propulsion and thermal management to novel wing designs and future liquid hydrogen storage tanks Additionally our 2021 acquisition of FlightAware continues to progress as we integrate aircraft tracking and AIdriven prediction tools into offerings for airports commercial and business aviation and even uncrewed aircraft system customers Smarter defense Raytheon Technologies continues to be an essential partner in US and allied defense We are a leader in the development of operational hypersonic and counterhypersonic systems a key strategy for the US military After a second successful flight test of the Hypersonic Airbreathing Weapon Concept in July the US Air Force awarded Raytheon Missiles  Defense a 1 billion contract to develop the Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile RMD also completed the systems requirement review for its glide phase interceptor prototype to defend the United States from hypersonic missile threats As part of the US government\u2019s support for Ukraine Raytheon Technologies\u2019 solutions are being used to defend Ukrainian citizens including the Javelin weapon system Stinger missiles and GPSguided Excalibur munitions In November the US Army \u201cSince entering service in 2016 GTF engines have saved more than one billion gallons of jet fuel and more than 10 million metric tons of CO2\u201d Adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow are nonGAAP financial measures See page 14 for additional information on nonGAAP measures awarded the company a 12 billion contract for six National Advanced SurfacetoAir Missile Systems for Ukraine and in December the US government announced plans to send a Global Patriot Solutions missile defense system to Ukraine In September Pratt  Whitney delivered its 1000th F135 engine\u2014the safest most capable military jet engine in operation We are also working on modernization of the F35 pairing Pratt  Whitney\u2019s F135 Engine Core Upgrade with Collins\u2019 Emergency Power and Cooling System for significantly more thrust range and thermal capabilities These engine system upgrades will greatly enhance engine efficiency and engine life as well as reduce life cycle cost This unique solution demonstrates the true power of our company Raytheon Technologies continues to support multidomain operations on several fronts including the next phase of development for the US Army\u2019s TITAN program a tactical ground station that finds and tracks threats to support longrange precision targeting Collins was awarded a production contract of up to 583 million for the Mounted Assured Positioning Navigation and Timing System Gen II Program RMD was awarded a 651 million contract with options totaling 25 billion for the ANSPY6V family of radars to equip 31 US Navy ships RMD also delivered the first Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor to the US\u00a0Army providing a stepped increase of performance from our legacy Patriot system defending against a range of threats from crewed and uncrewed aircraft to cruise missiles and ballistic\u00a0missiles Intelligent space technologies We continue to make advances in space technologies which we know will be essential for the future of global commerce scientific discovery and security In 2022 Raytheon Intelligence  Space delivered the ground test and flight operations system in support of the James Webb Space Telescope and Collins was selected to produce NASA\u2019s nextgeneration spacesuit for the International Space Station In November NASA launched Artemis 1 which included key subsystems and avionics from Collins and also included CubeSat miniature satellites that leverage precision avionics from our recently acquired Blue\u00a0Canyon\u00a0Technologies 2 RAYTHEON TECHNOLOGIES 2022 ANNUAL REPORT RAYTHEON TECHNOLOGIES 2022 ANNUAL REPORT 3 How we are advancing 2022 was our first full year using our common operating system known as CORE customeroriented results and excellence Our CORE system provides a common language toolset and methodology for delivering on customer commitments\u2014 all directed toward organic growth through greater collaboration Our CORE operating system is showcased in our new stateoftheart advanced casting foundry and airfoil production facility in Asheville North Carolina which opened its doors in November The facility\u2019s highly automated manufacturing will improve the quality and productivity of highvolume programs for decades to come Our modernization efforts are also reflected in our linking of more than15000 machine tools and test stands to our network and deploying an internetofthings layer to 46\u00a0additional factories Thanks to CORE initiatives in our factory in Largo Florida we achieved a 25 percent reduction in cycle time and a 10 percent reduction in floor space Clearly supply chain disruptions affected the global economy\u2014and Raytheon Technologies But we were able to reduce the impact through our dedicated team of specialists who worked with our 14000 product suppliers to monitor performance diagnose problems and find solutions We make products essential to national security and flight safety and the criticality of that fact underpins everything we do We understand the importance of delivering what customers need today while investing our time and talents innovating for the future We will make advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning to help enhance shared knowledge and to aid critical decisionmaking in aerospace defense and space We will also continue to develop advanced digital models that increase our industry\u2019s efficiency and

671 billion and adjusted earnings per share of 478 driven by the commercial air traffic rebound We spent more than 9 billion on research and development and capital expenditures in 2022 as we continue to invest in technology and innovation and fund future organic growth We generated 72 billion in cash flow from operations and ended the year with 49\u00a0billion in free cash flow despite a 16 billion additional US federal cash tax payment associated with the amortization of RD spending for federal tax purposes We continue to reduce costs achieving over 400 million in mergerrelated gross cost synergies These bring our total synergies to about 14 billion since the merger and we are on track to meet our target of 15 billion a year earlier than planned We also returned 59 billion to shareowners in 2022 through dividends and share repurchases bringing our capital return mergertodate to 133 billion Continued progress Sustainable aviation Raytheon Technologies\u2019 commitment to sustainable air travel continues to advance In October Airbus began development flight testing of the Pratt  Whitney GTF Advantage engine on an A320neo aircraft The GTF Advantage is the world\u2019s most efficient and sustainable singleaisle aircraft engine and last year it also proved capable of running on 100 percent sustainable aviation fuel Since entering service in 2016 GTF engines have saved more than one billion gallons of jet fuel and more than 10 million metric tons of CO2 Our leadership in sustainability was also evident in NASA\u2019s selection of Pratt\u00a0\u00a0Whitney to develop advanced engine technologies to reduce fuel consumption and emissions for the next singleaisle aircraft Meanwhile the European Union Commission selected Collins Aerospace and Pratt  Whitney via the Clean Aviation Joint Undertaking to team with EU and UK partners on seven sustainable aviation development projects ranging from hybrid electric propulsion and thermal management to novel wing designs and future liquid hydrogen storage tanks Additionally our 2021 acquisition of FlightAware continues to progress as we integrate aircraft tracking and AIdriven prediction tools into offerings for airports commercial and business aviation and even uncrewed aircraft system customers Smarter defense Raytheon Technologies continues to be an essential partner in US and allied defense We are a leader in the development of operational hypersonic and counterhypersonic systems a key strategy for the US military After a second successful flight test of the Hypersonic Airbreathing Weapon Concept in July the US Air Force awarded Raytheon Missiles  Defense a 1 billion contract to develop the Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile RMD also completed the systems requirement review for its glide phase interceptor prototype to defend the United States from hypersonic missile threats As part of the US government\u2019s support for Ukraine Raytheon Technologies\u2019 solutions are being used to defend Ukrainian citizens including the Javelin weapon system Stinger missiles and GPSguided Excalibur munitions In November the US Army \u201cSince entering service in 2016 GTF engines have saved more than one billion gallons of jet fuel and more than 10 million metric tons of CO2\u201d Adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow are nonGAAP financial measures See page 14 for additional information on nonGAAP measures awarded the company a 12 billion contract for six National Advanced SurfacetoAir Missile Systems for Ukraine and in December the US government announced plans to send a Global Patriot Solutions missile defense system to Ukraine In September Pratt  Whitney delivered its 1000th F135 engine\u2014the safest most capable military jet engine in operation We are also working on modernization of the F35 pairing Pratt  Whitney\u2019s F135 Engine Core Upgrade with Collins\u2019 Emergency Power and Cooling System for significantly more thrust range and thermal capabilities These engine system upgrades will greatly enhance engine efficiency and engine life as well as reduce life cycle cost This unique solution demonstrates the true power of our company Raytheon Technologies continues to support multidomain operations on several fronts including the next phase of development for the US Army\u2019s TITAN program a tactical ground station that finds and tracks threats to support longrange precision targeting Collins was awarded a production contract of up to 583 million for the Mounted Assured Positioning Navigation and Timing System Gen II Program RMD was awarded a 651 million contract with options totaling 25 billion for the ANSPY6V family of radars to equip 31 US Navy ships RMD also delivered the first Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor to the

advancing 2022 was our first full year using our common operating system known as CORE customeroriented results and excellence Our CORE system provides a common language toolset and methodology for delivering on customer commitments\u2014 all directed toward organic growth through greater collaboration Our CORE operating system is showcased in our new stateoftheart advanced casting foundry and airfoil production facility in Asheville North Carolina which opened its doors in November The facility\u2019s highly automated manufacturing will improve the quality and productivity of highvolume programs for decades to come Our modernization efforts are also reflected in our linking of more than15000 machine tools and test stands to our network and deploying an internetofthings layer to 46\u00a0additional factories Thanks to CORE initiatives in our factory in Largo Florida we achieved a 25 percent reduction in cycle time and a 10 percent reduction in floor space Clearly supply chain disruptions affected the global economy\u2014and Raytheon Technologies But we were able to reduce the impact through our dedicated team of specialists who worked with our 14000 product suppliers to monitor performance diagnose problems and find solutions We make products essential to national security and flight safety and the criticality of that fact underpins everything we do We understand the importance of delivering what customers need today while investing our time and talents innovating for the future We will make advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning to help enhance shared knowledge and to aid critical decisionmaking in aerospace defense and space We will also continue to develop advanced digital models that increase our industry\u2019s efficiency and productivity while investing in smart cyber solutions to ensure system safety Commitments to our communities and our workforce In 2022 we put our People Planet and Principles environmental social and governance strategy into practice We built and integrated measurement systems across our company adding the same engineering rigor and discipline we bring to our product development to our ESG strategy to create longterm outcomes that will impact generations to come As an example we can see clearly where we continue to make progress on diversity equity and inclusion We track global workforce shifts to determine where to make the most impactful community and academic investments that can help solve the pipeline challenge From there we are working to achieve executive gender parity aiming for 50\u00a0percent women executives across the globe And we seek to double the representation of people of color in executive roles compared to 2020 Improving opportunities for all people is aligned with maintaining the health of our planet As we look to the future as an industry we face critical questions about how to grow sustainably I believe Raytheon Technologies has the talent technology and vision to meet the environmental challenges ahead and to lead our industry into the\u00a0future Whether it is sustainability or workforce equity our ambitions are clearly outlined and we have prioritized progress Our Board of Directors reviews our plans and milestones regularly and assesses our performance in these areas under our annual incentive compensation plan Resilience leads to progress and growth Since the merger in 2020 we\u2019ve been tested\u2014by the pandemic by inflation and supply chain issues and by labor shortages And we have demonstrated our resilience We\u2019ve strived to maintain our commitments to our customers and communities and we\u2019ve built a backlog that supports our position as an industry leader As I write this letter we have just announced a reorganization of our business units to better position Raytheon Technologies for the future We stand on 100 years of pioneering technology and yet we still have the energy and opportunity of a newly formed company One thing you can count on We will continue to disrupt ourselves when needed in the ongoing pursuit of better ways to deliver value to our customers and all stakeholders My thanks to our dedicated team for another outstanding year And thanks to you our shareowners for your ongoing support of Raytheon Technologies as we continue to lead inspire and

strength and resilience but also our continued growth toward becoming a premier global financial services Our record financial performance was broadbased across all products and client segments More details\r\nregarding segment performance and composition can be found on pages 2627\r\nWe have also seen significant strength in the dollar over the past several quarters The majority of our earnings\r\nand variable compensation are denominated in dollars Despite this we have a significant amount of locally\r\ndenominated fixed expenses We believe the strong dollar reduced our 2022 expenses by approximately\r\n20 million when translating our nondollar expenses to dollars for reporting purposes We have entered into\r\ncertain hedging arrangements to continue to lock in this benefit\r\nOur strategy in action\r\nWe believe that our impressive 2022 financial results and our 20year track record of consistent and significant\r\nrevenue growth are directly correlated with our relentless focus on becoming a bestinclass global financial\r\nservices ecosystem\r\nWe have seen an increase in the cadence and delivery of our key projects and many of these are now through\r\nbeta testing and have either been launched or are currently awaiting deployment Our approach is always to\r\nintroduce and market our new capabilities at a steady incremental basis None of these projects in isolation\r\nwill result in a significant change to our current growth trajectory and certain initiatives may not be viable in the\r\nlong run In aggregate however we believe that these initiatives will \u2018bend our growth curve\u2019 upwards As many\r\nof these strategies are digital in nature as they are deployed we believe we will see operational leverage and\r\nscalability start to kick in and experience a steady improvement in margins\r\nTechnology and digitization are recurring themes throughout our strategic objectives set out below While\r\nthe legacy StoneX has traditionally focused on a hightouch approach catering to large commercial and\r\ninstitutional clients we have also ramped up our investment in technology significantly over the last 5 years\r\nThis has allowed us to become innovators by offering our hightouch clients better ways to engage with our\r\necosystem which will in turn make them stickier and more valuable As we accelerate towards a more digital\r\napproach we are engaging a much broader and deeper client base with a significantly larger TAM\r\nIn addition technology allows us to target new client segments where our traditional hightouch approach may\r\nnot be appropriate or costeffective As an example the acquisition of GAIN brought us a selfdirected mobile\r\nplatform focused on highnetworth retail and small professional trading clients This will also result in a more\r\nscalable infrastructure and increased operational leverage which should drive margins In short as we digitize\r\nwe are transforming ourselves into more of a fintech business\r\n2022 was another successful year where we made tremendous headway with each of our four strategic\r\ncompany objectives\r\nBuild our ecosystem \u2013 We must remain relevant to our clients and prospects by adding more of the products\r\nand services they want and by providing them with the best ecosystem possible for accessing the global\r\nfinancial markets Doing so enables us to increase engagement and wallet share from existing clients while\r\nattracting new clients who cannot satisfy their needs elsewhere or who are dissatisfied with how those needs\r\nare being met\r\nIn our securities segment we continued to expand both our product offering as well as our geographic reach\r\nOur securitiesbased revenues have grown by 33 over the last three years On the equities side we launched\r\nour electronic marketmaking capabilities to internalize and capture spread on domestic US equities while\r\nCHIEF EXECUTIVE\u2019S LETTER\r\n2022 ANNUAL

which we will ramp up incrementally over the\r\nnext year or so and one which has the potential to be a material source of revenue for the business\r\nOn the fixed income side we have steadily been diversifying into different asset classes to round out our\r\noffering We have started to leverage our capabilities internationally into Europe and Asia with the addition of\r\nkey professional hires to our team We also expanded our capabilities in both regions to support trading and\r\nclearing in a broad range of securities products We believe that we can leverage our broadbased product\r\ncapabilities and trading flows to provide liquidity and execution to clients on an increasingly global basis\r\nWe are planning to launch our cash equities capability to our international selfdirected retail platform in the first\r\nquarter of 2023 allowing clients to seamlessly trade investment products as well as leveraged OTC products\r\nIn the US we will be launching StoneX One which will offer a\r\nmultiasset class mobile trading platform to retail investors\r\nStoneX One will provide our retail clients with a truly\r\nunique crossasset platform with selfdirected execution\r\ncapabilities Initially this will include cash equities options\r\nand futures and will be followed shortly by foreign\r\nexchange cryptocurrency fixed income and precious\r\nmetals All the trading flow will be directed to our electronic\r\nmarketmaking platform which will give us the opportunity\r\nwhere appropriate to internalize spreads In the future we can leverage our wealth management capabilities\r\nby offering roboadvisory portfolio management and even estate planning options for our retail clients\r\nIn Brazil we have started work on our new Digital Pay In \u201cDPI\u201d offering which allows international companies\r\nto collect foreign currency payments from local clients in a digitally efficient way This has significant potential\r\nin Brazil and other jurisdictions and opens up a new and unique payments capability for our existing large\r\ncorporate clients\r\nAs we have done consistently for the last 20 years we continue to ensure that we offer broad access to\r\nproducts markets and exchanges that our clients want to access \u2013 in essence we open markets We\r\ncontinue to innovate and offer new and enhanced OTC hedging products to our clients and have invested in\r\nour technology stack to accomplish this faster and more effectively We are now introducing dozens of new\r\nproducts every month some of which are new and industry leading such as cattle swaps which we introduced\r\ninto Australia in October We have also added several new exchanges and liquidity venues In addition to\r\ngaining incremental revenue these new product offerings position StoneX as a leading innovator focused on\r\nadding value to our clients\r\nGrowdiversify client base \u2013 We are a clientcentric business and strive to grow our client footprint\r\nconsistently by entering new markets expanding market share in our existing markets and adding new client\r\nsegments and channels Our broad range of capabilities enables us to serve clients of nearly every type\r\nwhich creates a large addressable market for us and a significant opportunity for topline growth \u2013 given that\r\nour current market penetration is likely in the single basis point range Seizing this opportunity will enable us to\r\nincrease volume and lower earnings volatilityenterprise Operating revenues rose to a record 21 billion up 26 while net income exceeded 207 million up 78 Shareholder equity eclipsed the billiondollar benchmark for the first time rising to 107 billion For the past two decades our mission at StoneX has been to consistently look for new geographic markets\r\nand increase our product and service offering in turn driving our topline growth\r\nOur securities expansion has seen some early success as we seek to increase our client penetration outside\r\nthe US We are offering our products and capabilities to institutional investors in Europe and Asia where\r\nwe currently have limited market share and thus a large opportunity for client expansion We are currently\r\nbolstering our capabilities in London to enable a more wellrounded offering\r\nOur multiasset class digital trading platforms will substantially expand our retail addressable market and allow\r\nus to capture additional wallet share from existing clients We also plan to leverage these selfdirected trading\r\nplatforms to reach and service smaller agricultural producers specializing in row crops livestock and dairy\r\ndirectly via the Farm Advantage mobile platform This is a compelling opportunity for us to tap into a new and\r\npotentially large client segment\r\nWe have launched our digital payments offering in Brazil for small and mediumsized corporations seeking\r\ninternational payments which will soon be expanded to the US and Europe As we roll out this new platform\r\nwe will add the ability to hedge currencies as well as other products This is significant as it will enable us to\r\nleverage our proven product capabilities for hedging clients into an entirely new client segment Additionally\r\nwe will also be offering this payment capability to all our existing corporate clients further cementing our\r\nrelationships with themEarnings per share diluted were 1001 and we achieved an ROE of 21 despite our equity having increased by 39 over the last two years Over the past 20 years we have compounded operating revenue at 32 per annum and Digitize our business \u2013 We firmly believe that the digitization of client platforms \u2013 backed by highly agile and\r\nefficient infrastructure \u2013 is a key requisite for our continued growth We believe this digitization will enable us\r\nto increase global market share in our massive TAM more efficiently while simultaneously providing scalability\r\nand margin expansion Our keys to this approach are threefold 1 aggregation and ease of access to data\r\nacross the enterprise for strategic use 2 open flexible and modular architecture to enable scalability and 3\r\nopportunities for trade internalization across platforms that benefit our clients via better pricing and improve\r\nour bottom line via higher margins\r\nWe have made significant investments to develop a more efficient and scalable technology stack that enables\r\na faster cadence in delivering digital solutions for our clients These capabilities and platforms will be powered\r\nby our digital marketing team to drive adoption and increase incremental revenue\r\nWe have several projects underway which will make our internal processes more efficient and scalable\r\nallowing us to realize some operational leverage and margin expansion as we continue to grow Most of these\r\ninitiatives are underpinned by our \u201cdata lake\u201d project This allows us to access all data centrally and in real time\r\nfrom our many systems of record where the information is stored and normalized This dramatically reduces\r\nthe endtoend connections required by our functional areas to get a full view of client activity and generates\r\none place to obtain all relevant information\r\nWe continue to see this data being leveraged by several business segments to quickly deploy technology\r\nsolutions and better manage our operations Our risk management process has been enhanced and we now\r\nhave realtime monitoring capabilities across the business providing superior insight and ability to manage\r\nvolatile market conditions Our global platforms are also accessing this information allowing us to more\r\neffectively launch clientfacing applications During 2022 we substantially completed a multiyear conversion\r\nto a new system for accounting and human resources and are now enjoying some meaningful synergies and\r\nscalability as we continue to grow We have similar projects underway on the compliance and treasury side\r\nof our business which we are looking forward to implementing in the near future We have also introduced a\r\ncontract management system for our legal team a technology to better track and monitor internal audit and\r\noperational risk issues and incremental technology improvements for compliance and KYC monitoring\r\nDuring the year we launched StoneHedge for our grain merchandising clients This platform is deployed\r\nthroughout the client\u2019s enterprise allowing them to price and autohedge grain purchases in real time from the\r\nconvenience of a mobile device This platform is integrated into the client\u2019s enterprise system allowing all data\r\nto be instantly accessed driving efficiencies for the client Our technology division recently became a member\r\nof the SWIFT Partnership Program Membership provides StoneX clients with a direct connection to the SWIFT\r\nAPI platform which provides a new level of endtoend transparency StoneX Global Payments will be the first\r\nbusiness segment to deploy this new functionality with clients having full visibility into the status of their crossborder payments throughout the entire transaction lifecycle\r\nWe continue to deploy advanced technology across our trading businesses to efficiently price markets in a\r\nrapidly expanding product set as well as internalize trade flow to enhance spread capture and better monetize\r\nclient trading flow\r\nAll these initiatives and projects serve to make us a more efficient effective and scalable business\r\n2022 ANNUAL REPORT I 24\r\nCompound capital \u2013 From our earliest days we have focused on expanding our capital base by maintaining\r\nconsistent profitability and reinvesting those profits back into the business so that we can create our own\r\ncapital runway for growth We strive to deploy this capital wisely through a disciplined MA approach focused\r\non deals that will accrete immediately to earnings and by making allocation decisions focused on ROE We\r\nbelieve this approach has been key to our ability to achieve stable and consistent growth and we will continue\r\nto pursue it going forward\r\nIn fiscal 2022 we achieved an adjusted ROE of 21 significantly above our 15 target Additionally over the\r\npast ten years we have tripled our shareholder funds and completed over 20 acquisitions to strengthen our\r\nbusiness and expand our global client footprint This has all been achieved with a negligible increase in our\r\nissued share count as these acquisitions were largely financed organically from retained earnings and the\r\nunbelievable power of compounding\r\nStoneX is committed to identifying strategic opportunities and investments that deliver growth for our business\r\nand value to our clients and investors In November we announced the acquisition of Cotton Distributors Inc\r\nThis purchase not only enhances the value of our commodities trading business with physical cotton trading\r\ncapabilities but also expands our footprint in Brazil and Continental Europe\r\nOur patient and disciplined approach to acquisitions has reaped significant benefits for our shareholders as\r\nevidenced by our share price reaching alltime highs this year In April we closed the renewal of our parentlevel\r\ncredit facility through 2025 while also expanding the capacity under the facility to 475 million This expansion\r\nwas possible with additional support from existing lenders as well as several new banks joining our syndicate\r\nWith the support of this expanded group of bank partners we look forward to continuing to increase our\r\nproduct offerings to our growing client base in the years to come\r\nESG progress\r\nWe believe that a strong commitment to ESG practices is critical for our longterm success as a business\r\nas it influences our approach to risk management environmental impact community outreach corporate\r\ngovernance and ultimately the way we serve our clients\r\nStoneX recently became a member of the Nodal Exchange which offers renewable fuels and pollutants\r\ncontracts to support an increasing focus on corporate sustainability and carbon neutrality Our institutional\r\nclients can now access these environmental options and futures contracts which span markets that include\r\nsustainable energy carbon emissions renewable fuels and pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen\r\noxide We are committed to helping our clients access the widest range of commodityfocused contracts to\r\nmeet their environmentally focused goals\r\nWe are pleased to note that we have worked to diversify our board to set the \u201ctone at the top\u201d Our business\r\nsatisfies the NASDAQ diversity standard and we will continue to work hard to ensure StoneX is an inclusive and\r\ndiverse organization We do not see this merely as an ESG requirement but more as an essential ingredient to a\r\nhighperforming organization\r\nWe provide updates to some of the internal policies and initiatives we reported last year on page 28\r\nIn addition to providing updates to internal policies and initiatives we also detail some of the ways we are\r\nhelping our clients achieve their ESG objectives as well as the roles we are playing to facilitate the orderly and  shareholder capital at 28 per annum Over this same period our market value has increased from 15 million to 168 billion and our share price has effective function of those new markets that have arisen to serve their needs These include providing clients\r\nwith education and access to carbon credit markets globally adding access to a full suite of environmental\r\ncontracts to address the ESG needs of clients and our payments platform\u2019s ongoing track record of helping\r\nhundreds of charities and NGOs ensure millions of dollars make it from their donors to people on the ground\r\ncarrying out their missions\r\nLooking forward\r\nAs we look ahead to 2023 we will continue to relentlessly pursue our goal of becoming a leading financial\r\nservices platform and an integral part of the global financial infrastructure We anticipate heightened market\r\nvolatility and rising interest rates to continue to create a\r\ntailwind for our business However we also recognize that the\r\nanticipated global market downturn may pose a challenge\r\nin the future We will therefore continue to evolve and adjust\r\nour strategies based on developing economic conditions to\r\nensure our robust growth continues\r\nWe have validated our acquisition of GAIN through our results\r\nso far and have significantly expanded our footprint client reach and product offering\r\nWe have made large investments in technology over the last five years to put in place the foundations required\r\nto accelerate the digitization of our business As we continue to implement institutionalgrade platforms for\r\nour clients we should further accelerate our growth with the scalability that technology provides to increase\r\nmargins and profitability\r\nAs clients increasingly seek global solutions awareness of the StoneX brand and ecosystem grows across the\r\nglobal financial marketplace We are incredibly optimistic about our future and our ability to drive value to both\r\nour clients and shareholders\r\nAbove all we remain dedicated to our clientcentric culture Our commitment to serving our growing global\r\nclient footprint and providing bestinclass service is embedded into the StoneX DNA\r\nOn behalf of the entire executive management team I want to first and foremost thank all our clients  we are\r\ngrateful for your commitment and trust in our ability to drive value to your business I want to also thank all of\r\nmy StoneX colleagues for their continued dedication to making this year another incredible success along\r\nwith our board and advisors for their guidance our bankers for their financial support and our shareholders for\r\nentrusting their capital to us increased from 064 to 8294 \u2013 a gain of approximately 130 times1 Our robust 2022 financial results are a direct validation of the value of our client offering and our ongoing commitment to providing global market access institutionalgrade platforms and technology deep expertise and hightouch service We are continuously investing in our products and services and expanding our capabilities in areas where we can increase our market share We have an enormous total addressable market \u201cTAM\u201d in front of us which presents a significant opportunity for us to further develop our suite of services which we believe will further scale our business in 2023 and beyond Overview Fiscal 2022 was a year of exceptional growth and progress toward our longterm strategic objectives which include digitizing our offerings expanding our client base and building our global financial ecosystem We were pleased to see broadbased doubledigit revenue growth across all of our products and client segments with our business benefiting significantly from the effects of inflationary pressures on the global markets sharp increases in shortterm interest rates and continued volatility in both financial and physical markets As an example three of our five busiest days in the history of our business in terms of transactional volume occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 principally due to the Ukraine conflict  with the other two days occurring during the initial onset of the Covid pandemic in fiscal 2020 Almost two years ago in the middle of the Covid pandemic we concluded the acquisition of GAIN which was our largest acquisition to date At the outset the rationale for this strategic acquisition was that GAIN\u2019s retail clients would bring additional flow into products we already trade allowing us to combine this new flow with our existing trade flow We would also be able to provide clearing services and additional products that were previously inaccessible to GAIN\u2019s retail clients especially in US markets Furthermore we saw the opportunity for some easy cost synergies \u2013 most of which have been realized  as well as acquiring talented employees especially on the digital marketing side of our business CHIEF EXECUTIVE\u2019S LETTER 1 Share price and market cap data for NASDAQ SNEX ranges from 93002 to 93022 2022 ANNUAL REPORT I 19 Over the last two years our transaction rationale has been validated as GAIN has exceeded the expectations we laid out We effectively executed on all integration objectives and now see retail trading flow as a key part of our franchise In aggregate our average client float for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 was 86 billion up 50 from a year ago This sharp increase was due to growing engagement from existing clients strong organic growth in our client footprint and higher margin rates caused by rising volatility In the wake of 2022\u2019s rate hikes we have experienced an acceleration in interest earnings on client balances up 243 for the full fiscal year versus 2021 with the majority of this growth being recorded in the fourth quarter These significant increases in both product volumes and client float speak to the broadening and deepening of our client base and the validation of our strategy as well as to the continued effort and dedication of our team in expanding the StoneX

details\r\nregarding segment performance and composition can be found on pages 2627\r\nWe have also seen significant strength in the dollar over the past several quarters The majority of our earnings\r\nand variable compensation are denominated in dollars Despite this we have a significant amount of locally\r\ndenominated fixed expenses We believe the strong dollar reduced our 2022 expenses by approximately\r\n20 million when translating our nondollar expenses to dollars for reporting purposes We have entered into\r\ncertain hedging arrangements to continue to lock in this benefit\r\nOur strategy in action\r\nWe believe that our impressive 2022 financial results and our 20year track record of consistent and significant\r\nrevenue growth are directly correlated with our relentless focus on becoming a bestinclass global financial\r\nservices ecosystem\r\nWe have seen an increase in the cadence and delivery of our key projects and many of these are now through\r\nbeta testing and have either been launched or are currently awaiting deployment Our approach is always to\r\nintroduce and market our new capabilities at a steady incremental basis None of these projects in isolation\r\nwill result in a significant change to our current growth trajectory and certain initiatives may not be viable in the\r\nlong run In aggregate however we believe that these initiatives will \u2018bend our growth curve\u2019 upwards As many\r\nof these strategies are digital in nature as they are deployed we believe we will see operational leverage and\r\nscalability start to kick in and experience a steady improvement in margins\r\nTechnology and digitization are recurring themes throughout our strategic objectives set out below While\r\nthe legacy StoneX has traditionally focused on a hightouch approach catering to large commercial and\r\ninstitutional clients we have also ramped up our investment in technology significantly over the last 5 years\r\nThis has allowed us to become innovators by offering our hightouch clients better ways to engage with our\r\necosystem which will in turn make them stickier and more valuable As we accelerate towards a more digital\r\napproach we are engaging a much broader and deeper client base with a significantly larger TAM\r\nIn addition technology allows us to target new client segments where our traditional hightouch approach may\r\nnot be appropriate or costeffective As an example the acquisition of GAIN brought us a selfdirected mobile\r\nplatform focused on highnetworth retail and small professional trading clients This will also result in a more\r\nscalable infrastructure and increased operational leverage which should drive margins In short as we digitize\r\nwe are transforming ourselves into more of a fintech business\r\n2022 was another successful year where we made tremendous headway with each of our four strategic\r\ncompany objectives\r\nBuild our ecosystem \u2013 We must remain relevant to our clients and prospects by adding more of the products\r\nand services they want and by providing them with the best ecosystem possible for accessing the global\r\nfinancial markets Doing so enables us to increase engagement and wallet share from existing clients while\r\nattracting new clients who cannot satisfy their needs elsewhere or who are dissatisfied with how those needs\r\nare being met\r\nIn our securities segment we continued to expand both our product offering as well as our geographic reach\r\nOur securitiesbased revenues have grown by 33 over the last three years On the equities side we launched\r\nour electronic marketmaking capabilities to internalize and capture spread on domestic US equities while\r\nCHIEF EXECUTIVE\u2019S LETTER\r\n2022 ANNUAL

which we will ramp up incrementally over the\r\nnext year or so and one which has the potential to be a material source of revenue for the business\r\nOn the fixed income side we have steadily been diversifying into different asset classes to round out our\r\noffering We have started to leverage our capabilities internationally into Europe and Asia with the addition of\r\nkey professional hires to our team We also expanded our capabilities in both regions to support trading and\r\nclearing in a broad range of securities products We believe that we can leverage our broadbased product\r\ncapabilities and trading flows to provide liquidity and execution to clients on an increasingly global basis\r\nWe are planning to launch our cash equities capability to our international selfdirected retail platform in the first\r\nquarter of 2023 allowing clients to seamlessly trade investment products as well as leveraged OTC products\r\nIn the US we will be launching StoneX One which will offer a\r\nmultiasset class mobile trading platform to retail investors\r\nStoneX One will provide our retail clients with a truly\r\nunique crossasset platform with selfdirected execution\r\ncapabilities Initially this will include cash equities options\r\nand futures and will be followed shortly by foreign\r\nexchange cryptocurrency fixed income and precious\r\nmetals All the trading flow will be directed to our electronic\r\nmarketmaking platform which will give us the opportunity\r\nwhere appropriate to internalize spreads In the future we can leverage our wealth management capabilities\r\nby offering roboadvisory portfolio management and even estate planning options for our retail clients\r\nIn Brazil we have started work on our new Digital Pay In \u201cDPI\u201d offering which allows international companies\r\nto collect foreign currency payments from local clients in a digitally efficient way This has significant potential\r\nin Brazil and

offer broad access to\r\nproducts markets and exchanges that our clients want to access \u2013 in essence we open markets We\r\ncontinue to innovate and offer new and enhanced OTC hedging products to our clients and have invested in\r\nour technology stack to accomplish this faster and more effectively We are now introducing dozens of new\r\nproducts every month some of which are new and industry leading such as cattle swaps which we introduced\r\ninto Australia in October We have also added several new exchanges and liquidity venues In addition to\r\ngaining incremental revenue these new

for new geographic markets\r\nand increase our product and service offering in turn driving our topline growth\r\nOur securities expansion has seen some early success as we seek to increase our client penetration outside\r\nthe US We are offering our products and capabilities to institutional investors in Europe and Asia where\r\nwe currently have limited market share and thus a large opportunity for client expansion We are currently\r\nbolstering our capabilities in London to enable a more wellrounded offering\r\nOur multiasset class digital trading platforms will substantially expand our retail addressable market and allow\r\nus to capture additional wallet share from existing clients We also plan to leverage these selfdirected trading\r\nplatforms to reach and service smaller agricultural producers specializing in row crops livestock and dairy\r\ndirectly via the Farm Advantage mobile platform This is a compelling opportunity for us to tap into a new and\r\npotentially large client segment\r\nWe have launched our digital payments offering in Brazil for small and mediumsized corporations seeking\r\ninternational payments which will soon be expanded to the US and Europe As we roll out this new platform\r\nwe will add the ability to hedge currencies as well as other products This is significant as it will enable us to\r\nleverage our proven product capabilities for hedging clients into an entirely new client segment Additionally\r\nwe will also be offering this payment capability to all our existing corporate clients further cementing our\r\nrelationships with themEarnings per share diluted were 1001 and we achieved an ROE of 21 despite our equity having increased by 39 over the last two years Over the past 20 years we have compounded operating revenue at 32 per annum and Digitize our business \u2013 We firmly believe that the digitization of client platforms \u2013 backed by highly agile and\r\nefficient infrastructure \u2013 is a key requisite for our continued growth We believe this digitization will enable us\r\nto increase global market share in our massive TAM more efficiently while simultaneously providing scalability\r\nand margin expansion Our keys to this approach are threefold 1 aggregation and ease of access to data\r\nacross the enterprise for strategic use 2 open flexible and modular architecture to enable scalability and 3\r\nopportunities for trade internalization across platforms that benefit our clients via better pricing and improve\r\nour bottom line via higher margins\r\nWe have made significant investments to develop a more efficient and scalable technology stack that enables\r\na faster cadence in delivering digital solutions for our clients These capabilities and platforms will be powered\r\nby our digital marketing team to drive adoption and increase incremental revenue\r\nWe have several projects underway which will make our internal processes more efficient and scalable\r\nallowing us to realize some operational leverage and margin expansion as we continue to grow Most of these\r\ninitiatives are underpinned by our \u201cdata lake\u201d project This allows us to access all data centrally and in real time\r\nfrom our many systems of record where the information is stored and normalized This dramatically reduces\r\nthe endtoend connections required by our functional areas to get a full view of client activity and generates\r\none place to obtain all relevant information\r\nWe continue to see this data being leveraged by several business segments to quickly deploy technology\r\nsolutions and better manage our operations Our risk management process has been enhanced and we now\r\nhave realtime monitoring capabilities across the business providing superior insight and ability to manage\r\nvolatile market conditions Our global platforms are also accessing this information allowing us to more\r\neffectively launch clientfacing applications During 2022 we substantially completed a multiyear conversion\r\nto a new system for accounting and human resources and are now enjoying some meaningful synergies and\r\nscalability as we continue to grow We have similar projects underway on the compliance and treasury side\r\nof our business which we are looking forward to implementing in the near future We have also introduced a\r\ncontract management system for our legal team a technology to better track and monitor internal audit and\r\noperational risk issues and incremental technology improvements for compliance and KYC monitoring\r\nDuring the year we launched StoneHedge for our grain merchandising clients This platform is deployed\r\nthroughout the client\u2019s enterprise allowing them to price and autohedge grain purchases in real time from the\r\nconvenience of a mobile device This platform is integrated into the client\u2019s enterprise system allowing all data\r\nto be instantly accessed driving efficiencies for the client Our technology division recently became a member\r\nof the SWIFT Partnership Program Membership provides StoneX clients with a direct connection to the SWIFT\r\nAPI platform which provides a new level of endtoend transparency StoneX Global Payments will be the first\r\nbusiness segment to deploy this new functionality with clients having full visibility into the status of their crossborder payments throughout the entire transaction lifecycle\r\nWe continue to deploy advanced technology across our trading businesses to efficiently price markets in a\r\nrapidly expanding product set as well as internalize trade flow to enhance spread capture and better monetize\r\nclient trading flow\r\nAll these initiatives and projects serve to make us a more efficient effective and scalable business\r\n2022 ANNUAL REPORT I 24\r\nCompound capital \u2013 From our earliest days we have focused on expanding our capital base by maintaining\r\nconsistent profitability and reinvesting those profits back into the business so that we can create our own\r\ncapital runway for growth We strive to deploy this capital wisely through a disciplined MA approach focused\r\non deals that will accrete immediately to earnings and by making allocation decisions focused on ROE We\r\nbelieve this approach has been key to our ability to achieve stable and consistent growth and we will continue\r\nto pursue it going forward\r\nIn fiscal 2022 we achieved an adjusted ROE of 21 significantly above our 15 target Additionally over the\r\npast ten years we have tripled our shareholder funds and completed over 20 acquisitions to strengthen our\r\nbusiness and expand our global client footprint This has all been achieved with a negligible increase in our\r\nissued share count as these acquisitions were largely financed organically from retained earnings and the\r\nunbelievable power of compounding\r\nStoneX is committed to identifying strategic opportunities and investments that deliver growth for our business\r\nand value to our clients and investors In November we announced the acquisition of Cotton Distributors Inc\r\nThis purchase not only enhances the value of our commodities trading business with physical cotton trading\r\ncapabilities but also expands our footprint in Brazil and Continental Europe\r\nOur patient and disciplined approach to acquisitions has reaped significant benefits for our shareholders as\r\nevidenced by our share price reaching alltime highs this year In April we closed the renewal of our parentlevel\r\ncredit facility through 2025 while also expanding the capacity under the facility to 475 million This expansion\r\nwas possible with additional support from existing lenders as well as several new banks joining our syndicate\r\nWith the support of this expanded group of bank partners we look forward to continuing to increase our\r\nproduct offerings to our growing client base in the years to come\r\nESG progress\r\nWe believe that a strong commitment to ESG practices is critical for our longterm success as a business\r\nas it influences our approach to risk management environmental impact community outreach corporate\r\ngovernance and ultimately the way we serve our clients\r\nStoneX recently became a member of the Nodal Exchange which offers renewable fuels and pollutants\r\ncontracts to support an increasing focus on corporate sustainability and carbon neutrality Our institutional\r\nclients can now access these environmental options and futures contracts which span markets that include\r\nsustainable energy carbon emissions renewable fuels and pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen\r\noxide We are committed to helping our clients access the widest range of commodityfocused contracts to\r\nmeet their environmentally focused goals\r\nWe are pleased to note that we have worked to diversify our board to set the \u201ctone at the top\u201d Our business\r\nsatisfies the NASDAQ diversity standard and we will continue to work hard to ensure StoneX is an inclusive and\r\ndiverse organization We do not see this merely as an ESG requirement but more as an essential ingredient to a\r\nhighperforming organization\r\nWe provide updates to some of the internal policies and initiatives we reported last year on page 28\r\nIn addition to providing updates to internal policies and initiatives we also detail some of the ways we are\r\nhelping our clients achieve their ESG objectives as well as the roles we are playing to facilitate the orderly and  shareholder capital at 28 per annum Over this same period our market value has increased from 15 million to 168 billion and our share price has effective function of those new markets that have arisen to serve their needs These include providing clients\r\nwith education and access to carbon credit markets globally adding access to a full suite of environmental\r\ncontracts to address the ESG needs of clients and our payments platform\u2019s ongoing track record of helping\r\nhundreds of charities and NGOs ensure millions of dollars make it from their donors to people on the ground\r\ncarrying out their missions\r\nLooking forward\r\nAs we look ahead to 2023 we will continue to relentlessly pursue our goal of becoming a leading financial\r\nservices platform and an integral part of the global financial infrastructure We anticipate heightened market\r\nvolatility and rising interest rates to continue to create a\r\ntailwind for our business However we also recognize that the\r\nanticipated global market downturn may pose a challenge\r\nin the future We will therefore continue to evolve and adjust\r\nour strategies based on developing economic conditions to\r\nensure our robust growth continues\r\nWe have validated our acquisition of GAIN through our results\r\nso far and have significantly expanded our footprint client reach and product offering\r\nWe have made large investments in technology over the last five years to put in place the foundations required\r\nto accelerate the digitization of our business As we continue to implement institutionalgrade platforms for\r\nour clients we should further accelerate our growth with the scalability that technology provides to increase\r\nmargins and profitability\r\nAs clients increasingly seek global solutions awareness of the StoneX brand and ecosystem grows across the\r\nglobal financial marketplace We are incredibly optimistic about our future and our ability to drive value to both\r\nour clients and shareholders\r\nAbove all we remain dedicated to our clientcentric culture Our commitment to serving our growing global\r\nclient footprint and providing bestinclass service is embedded into the StoneX DNA\r\nOn behalf of the entire executive management team I want to first and foremost thank all our clients  we are\r\ngrateful for your commitment and trust in our ability to drive value to your business I want to also thank all of\r\nmy StoneX colleagues for their continued dedication to making this year another incredible success along\r\nwith our board and advisors for their guidance our bankers for their financial support and our shareholders for\r\nentrusting their capital to us increased from 064 to 8294 \u2013 a gain of approximately 130 times1 Our robust 2022 financial results are a direct validation of the value of our client offering and our ongoing commitment to providing global market access institutionalgrade platforms and technology deep expertise and hightouch service We are continuously investing in our products and services and expanding our capabilities in areas where we can increase our market share We have an enormous total addressable market \u201cTAM\u201d in front of us which presents a significant opportunity for us to further develop our suite of services which we believe will further scale our business in 2023 and beyond Overview Fiscal 2022 was a year of exceptional growth and progress toward our longterm strategic objectives which include digitizing our offerings expanding our client base and building our global financial ecosystem We were pleased to see broadbased doubledigit revenue growth across all of our products and client segments with our business benefiting significantly from the effects of inflationary pressures on the global markets sharp increases in shortterm interest rates and continued volatility in both financial and physical markets As an example three of our five busiest days in the history of our business in terms of transactional volume occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 principally due to the Ukraine conflict  with the other two days occurring during the initial onset of the Covid pandemic in fiscal 2020 Almost two years ago in the middle of the Covid pandemic we concluded the acquisition of GAIN which was our largest acquisition to date At the outset the rationale for this strategic acquisition was that GAIN\u2019s retail clients would bring additional flow into products we already trade allowing us to combine this new flow with our existing trade flow We would also be able to provide clearing services and additional products that were previously inaccessible to GAIN\u2019s retail clients especially in US markets Furthermore we saw the opportunity for some easy cost synergies \u2013 most of which have been realized  as well as acquiring talented employees especially on the digital marketing side of our business CHIEF EXECUTIVE\u2019S LETTER 1 Share price and market cap data for NASDAQ SNEX ranges from 93002 to 93022 2022 ANNUAL REPORT I 19 Over the last two years our transaction rationale has been validated as GAIN has exceeded the expectations we laid out We effectively executed on all integration objectives and now see retail trading flow as a key part of our franchise In aggregate our average client float for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 was 86 billion up 50 from a year ago This sharp increase was due to growing engagement from existing clients strong organic growth in our client footprint and higher margin rates caused by rising volatility In the wake of 2022\u2019s rate hikes we have experienced an acceleration in interest earnings on client balances up 243 for the full fiscal year versus 2021 with the majority of this growth being recorded in the fourth quarter These significant increases in both product volumes and client float speak to the broadening and deepening of our client base and the validation of our strategy as well as to the continued effort and dedication of our team in expanding the StoneX

strength and resilience but also our continued growth toward becoming a premier global financial services Our record financial performance was broadbased across all products and client segments More details\r\nregarding segment performance and composition can be found on pages 2627\r\nWe have also seen significant strength in the dollar over the past several quarters The majority of our earnings\r\nand variable compensation are denominated in dollars Despite this we have a significant amount of locally\r\ndenominated fixed expenses We believe the strong dollar reduced our 2022 expenses by approximately\r\n20 million when translating our nondollar expenses to dollars for reporting purposes We have entered into\r\ncertain hedging arrangements to continue to lock in this benefit\r\nOur strategy in action\r\nWe believe that our impressive 2022 financial results and our 20year track record of consistent and significant\r\nrevenue growth are directly correlated with our relentless focus on becoming a bestinclass global financial\r\nservices ecosystem\r\nWe have seen an increase in the cadence and delivery of our key projects and many of these are now through\r\nbeta

in isolation\r\nwill result in a significant change to our current growth trajectory and certain initiatives may not be viable in the\r\nlong run In aggregate however we believe that these initiatives will \u2018bend our growth curve\u2019 upwards As many\r\nof these strategies are digital in nature as they are deployed we believe we will see operational leverage and\r\nscalability start to kick in and experience a steady improvement in margins\r\nTechnology and digitization are recurring themes throughout our strategic objectives set out below While\r\nthe legacy StoneX has traditionally focused on a hightouch approach catering to large commercial and\r\ninstitutional clients we have also ramped up our investment in technology significantly over the last 5 years\r\nThis has allowed us to become innovators by offering our hightouch clients better ways to engage with our\r\necosystem which will in turn make them stickier and more valuable As we accelerate towards a more digital\r\napproach we are engaging a much broader and deeper client base with a significantly larger TAM\r\nIn addition technology allows us to target new client segments where our traditional hightouch approach may\r\nnot be appropriate or costeffective As an example the acquisition of GAIN brought us a selfdirected mobile\r\nplatform focused on highnetworth retail and small professional trading clients This will also result in a more\r\nscalable infrastructure and increased operational leverage which should drive margins In short as we digitize\r\nwe are transforming ourselves into more of a fintech business\r\n2022 was another successful year where we made tremendous headway with each of our four strategic\r\ncompany objectives\r\nBuild our ecosystem \u2013 We must remain relevant to our clients and prospects by adding more of the products\r\nand services they want and by providing them with the best ecosystem possible for accessing the global\r\nfinancial markets Doing so enables us to increase engagement and wallet share from existing clients while\r\nattracting new clients who cannot satisfy their needs elsewhere or who are dissatisfied with how those needs\r\nare being met\r\nIn our securities segment we continued to expand both our product offering as well as our geographic reach\r\nOur securitiesbased revenues have grown by 33 over the last three years On the equities side we launched\r\nour electronic marketmaking capabilities to internalize and capture spread on domestic US equities while\r\nCHIEF EXECUTIVE\u2019S LETTER\r\n2022 ANNUAL REPORT I 21\r\nproviding best execution We are leveraging our longstanding institutional relationships of over 20 years on the\r\ninternational equities side This is a new market opportunity for us which we will ramp up incrementally over the\r\nnext year or so and one which has the potential to be a material source of revenue for the business\r\nOn the fixed income side we have steadily been diversifying into different asset classes to round out our\r\noffering We have started to leverage our capabilities internationally into Europe and Asia with the addition of\r\nkey professional hires to our team We also expanded our capabilities in both regions to support trading and\r\nclearing in a broad range of securities products We believe that we can leverage our broadbased product\r\ncapabilities and trading flows to provide liquidity and execution to clients on an increasingly global basis\r\nWe are planning to launch our cash equities capability to our international selfdirected retail platform in the first\r\nquarter of 2023 allowing clients to seamlessly trade investment products as well as leveraged OTC products\r\nIn the US we will be launching StoneX One which will offer a\r\nmultiasset class mobile trading platform to retail investors\r\nStoneX One will provide our retail clients with a truly\r\nunique crossasset platform with selfdirected execution\r\ncapabilities Initially this will include cash equities options\r\nand futures and will be followed shortly by foreign\r\nexchange cryptocurrency fixed income and precious\r\nmetals All the trading flow will be directed to our electronic\r\nmarketmaking platform which will give us the opportunity\r\nwhere appropriate to internalize spreads In the future we can leverage our wealth management capabilities\r\nby offering roboadvisory portfolio management and even estate planning options for our retail clients\r\nIn Brazil we have started work on our new Digital Pay In \u201cDPI\u201d offering which allows international companies\r\nto collect foreign currency payments from local clients in a digitally efficient way This has significant potential\r\nin Brazil and other jurisdictions and opens up a new and unique payments capability for our existing large\r\ncorporate clients\r\nAs we have done consistently for the last 20 years we continue to ensure that we offer broad access to\r\nproducts markets and exchanges that our clients want to access \u2013 in essence we open markets We\r\ncontinue to innovate and offer new and enhanced OTC hedging products to our clients and have invested in\r\nour technology stack to accomplish this faster and more effectively We are now introducing dozens of new\r\nproducts every month some of which are new and industry leading such as cattle swaps which we introduced\r\ninto Australia in October We have also added several new exchanges and liquidity venues In addition to\r\ngaining incremental revenue these new product offerings position StoneX as a leading innovator focused on\r\nadding value to our clients\r\nGrowdiversify client base \u2013 We are a clientcentric business and strive to grow our client footprint\r\nconsistently by entering new markets expanding market share in our existing markets and adding new client\r\nsegments and channels Our broad range of capabilities enables us to serve clients of nearly every type\r\nwhich creates a large addressable market for us and a significant opportunity for topline growth \u2013 given that\r\nour current market penetration is likely in the single basis point range Seizing this opportunity will enable us to\r\nincrease volume and lower earnings volatilityenterprise Operating revenues rose to a record 21 billion up 26 while net income exceeded 207 million up 78 Shareholder equity eclipsed the billiondollar benchmark for the first time rising to 107 billion For the past two decades our mission at StoneX has been to consistently look for new geographic markets\r\nand increase our product and service offering in turn driving our topline growth\r\nOur securities expansion has seen some early success as we seek to increase our client penetration outside\r\nthe US We are offering our products and capabilities to institutional investors in Europe and Asia where\r\nwe currently have limited market share and thus a large opportunity for client expansion We are currently\r\nbolstering our capabilities in London to enable a more wellrounded offering\r\nOur multiasset class digital trading platforms will substantially expand our retail addressable market and allow\r\nus to capture additional wallet share from existing clients We also plan to leverage these selfdirected trading\r\nplatforms to reach and service smaller agricultural producers specializing in row crops livestock and dairy\r\ndirectly via the Farm Advantage mobile platform This is a compelling opportunity for us to tap into a new and\r\npotentially large client segment\r\nWe have launched our digital payments offering in Brazil for small and mediumsized corporations seeking\r\ninternational payments which will soon be expanded to the US and Europe As we roll out this new platform\r\nwe will add the ability to hedge currencies as well as other products This is significant as it will enable us to\r\nleverage our proven product capabilities for hedging clients into an entirely new client segment Additionally\r\nwe will also be offering this payment capability to all our existing corporate clients further cementing our\r\nrelationships with themEarnings per share diluted were 1001 and we achieved an ROE of 21 despite our equity having increased by 39 over the last two years Over the past 20 years we have compounded operating revenue at 32 per annum and Digitize our business \u2013 We firmly believe that the digitization of client platforms \u2013 backed by highly agile and\r\nefficient infrastructure \u2013 is a key requisite for our continued growth We believe this digitization will enable us\r\nto increase global market share in our massive TAM more efficiently while simultaneously providing scalability\r\nand margin expansion Our keys to this approach are threefold 1 aggregation and ease of access to data\r\nacross the enterprise for strategic use 2 open flexible and modular architecture to enable scalability and 3\r\nopportunities for trade internalization across platforms that benefit our clients via better pricing and improve\r\nour bottom line via higher margins\r\nWe have made significant investments to develop a more efficient and scalable technology stack that enables\r\na faster cadence in delivering digital solutions for our clients These capabilities and platforms will be powered\r\nby our digital marketing team to drive adoption and increase incremental revenue\r\nWe have several projects underway which will make our internal processes more efficient and scalable\r\nallowing us to realize some operational leverage and margin expansion as we continue to grow Most of these\r\ninitiatives are underpinned by our \u201cdata lake\u201d project This allows us to access all data centrally and in real time\r\nfrom our many systems of record where the information is stored and normalized This dramatically reduces\r\nthe endtoend connections required by our functional areas to get a full view of client activity and generates\r\none place to obtain all relevant information\r\nWe continue to see this data being leveraged by several business segments to quickly deploy technology\r\nsolutions and better manage our operations Our risk management process has been enhanced and we now\r\nhave realtime monitoring capabilities across the business providing superior insight and ability to manage\r\nvolatile market conditions Our global platforms are also accessing this information allowing us to more\r\neffectively launch clientfacing applications During 2022 we substantially completed a multiyear conversion\r\nto a new system for accounting and human resources and are now enjoying some meaningful synergies and\r\nscalability as we continue to grow We have similar projects underway on the compliance and treasury side\r\nof our business which we are looking forward to implementing in the near future We have also introduced a\r\ncontract management system for our legal team a technology to better track and monitor internal audit and\r\noperational risk issues and incremental technology improvements for compliance and KYC monitoring\r\nDuring the year we launched StoneHedge for our grain merchandising clients This platform is deployed\r\nthroughout the client\u2019s enterprise allowing them to price and autohedge grain purchases in real time from the\r\nconvenience of a mobile device This platform is integrated into the client\u2019s enterprise system allowing all data\r\nto be instantly accessed driving efficiencies for the client Our technology division recently became a member\r\nof the SWIFT Partnership Program Membership provides StoneX clients with a direct connection to the SWIFT\r\nAPI platform which provides a new level of endtoend transparency StoneX Global Payments will be the first\r\nbusiness segment to deploy this new functionality with clients having full visibility into the status of their crossborder payments throughout the entire transaction lifecycle\r\nWe continue to deploy advanced technology across our trading businesses to efficiently price markets in a\r\nrapidly expanding product set as well as internalize trade flow to enhance spread capture and better monetize\r\nclient trading flow\r\nAll these initiatives and projects serve to make us a more efficient effective and scalable business\r\n2022 ANNUAL REPORT I 24\r\nCompound capital \u2013 From our earliest days we have focused on expanding our capital base by maintaining\r\nconsistent profitability and reinvesting those profits back into the business so that we can create our own\r\ncapital runway for growth We strive to deploy this capital wisely through a disciplined MA approach focused\r\non deals that will accrete immediately to earnings and by making allocation decisions focused on ROE We\r\nbelieve this approach has been key to our ability to achieve stable and consistent growth and we will continue\r\nto pursue it going forward\r\nIn fiscal 2022 we achieved an adjusted ROE of 21 significantly above our 15 target Additionally over the\r\npast ten years we have tripled our shareholder funds and completed over 20 acquisitions to strengthen our\r\nbusiness and expand our global client footprint This has all been achieved with a negligible increase in our\r\nissued share count as these acquisitions were largely financed organically from retained earnings and the\r\nunbelievable power of compounding\r\nStoneX is committed to identifying strategic opportunities and investments that deliver growth for our business\r\nand value to our clients and investors In November we announced the acquisition of Cotton Distributors Inc\r\nThis purchase not only enhances the value of our commodities trading business with physical cotton trading\r\ncapabilities but also expands our footprint in Brazil and Continental Europe\r\nOur patient and disciplined approach to acquisitions has reaped significant benefits for our shareholders as\r\nevidenced by our share price reaching alltime highs this year In April we closed the renewal of our parentlevel\r\ncredit facility through 2025 while also expanding the capacity under the facility to 475 million This expansion\r\nwas possible with additional support from existing lenders as well as several new banks joining our syndicate\r\nWith the support of this expanded group of bank partners we look forward to continuing to increase our\r\nproduct offerings to our growing client base in the years to come\r\nESG progress\r\nWe believe that a strong commitment to ESG practices is critical for our longterm success as a business\r\nas it influences our approach to risk management environmental impact community outreach corporate\r\ngovernance and ultimately the way we serve our clients\r\nStoneX recently became a member of the Nodal Exchange which offers renewable fuels and pollutants\r\ncontracts to support an increasing focus on corporate sustainability and carbon neutrality Our institutional\r\nclients can now access these environmental options and futures contracts which span markets that include\r\nsustainable energy carbon emissions renewable fuels and pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen\r\noxide We are committed to helping our clients access the widest range of commodityfocused contracts to\r\nmeet their environmentally focused goals\r\nWe are pleased to note that we have worked to diversify our board to set the \u201ctone at the top\u201d Our business\r\nsatisfies the NASDAQ diversity standard and we will continue to work hard to ensure StoneX is an inclusive and\r\ndiverse organization We do not see this merely as an ESG requirement but more as an essential ingredient to a\r\nhighperforming organization\r\nWe provide updates to some of the internal policies and initiatives we reported last year on page 28\r\nIn addition to providing updates to internal policies and initiatives we also detail some of the ways we are\r\nhelping our clients achieve their ESG objectives as well as the roles we are playing to facilitate the orderly and  shareholder capital at 28 per annum Over this same period our market value has increased from 15 million to 168 billion and our share price has effective function of those new markets that have arisen to serve their needs These include providing clients\r\nwith education and access to carbon credit markets globally adding access to a full suite of environmental\r\ncontracts to address the ESG needs of clients and our payments platform\u2019s ongoing track record of helping\r\nhundreds of charities and NGOs ensure millions of dollars make it from their donors to people on the ground\r\ncarrying out their missions\r\nLooking forward\r\nAs we look ahead to 2023 we will continue to relentlessly pursue our goal of becoming a leading financial\r\nservices platform and an integral part of the global financial infrastructure We anticipate heightened market\r\nvolatility and rising interest rates to continue to create a\r\ntailwind for our business However we also recognize that the\r\nanticipated global market downturn may pose a challenge\r\nin the future We will therefore continue to evolve and adjust\r\nour strategies based on developing economic conditions to\r\nensure our robust growth continues\r\nWe have validated our acquisition of GAIN through our results\r\nso far and have significantly expanded our footprint client reach and product offering\r\nWe have made large investments in technology over the last five years to put in place the foundations required\r\nto accelerate the digitization of our business As we continue to implement institutionalgrade platforms for\r\nour clients we should further accelerate our growth with the scalability that technology provides to increase\r\nmargins and profitability\r\nAs clients increasingly seek global solutions awareness of the StoneX brand and ecosystem grows across the\r\nglobal financial marketplace We are incredibly optimistic about our future and our ability to drive value to both\r\nour clients and shareholders\r\nAbove all we remain dedicated to our clientcentric culture Our commitment to serving our growing global\r\nclient footprint and providing bestinclass service is embedded into the StoneX DNA\r\nOn behalf of the entire executive management team I want to first and foremost thank all our clients  we are\r\ngrateful for your commitment and trust in our ability to drive value to your business I want to also thank all of\r\nmy StoneX colleagues for their continued dedication to making this year another incredible success along\r\nwith our board and advisors for their guidance our bankers for their financial support and our shareholders for\r\nentrusting their capital to us increased from 064 to 8294 \u2013 a gain of approximately 130 times1 Our robust 2022 financial results are a direct validation of the value of our client offering and our ongoing commitment to providing global market access institutionalgrade platforms and technology deep expertise and hightouch service We are continuously investing in our products and services and expanding our capabilities in areas where we can increase our market share We have an enormous total addressable market \u201cTAM\u201d in front of us which presents a significant opportunity for us to further develop our suite of services which we believe will further scale our business in 2023 and beyond Overview Fiscal 2022 was a year of exceptional growth and progress toward our longterm strategic objectives which include digitizing our offerings expanding our client base and building our global financial ecosystem We were pleased to see broadbased doubledigit revenue growth across all of our products and client segments with our business benefiting significantly from the effects of inflationary pressures on the global markets sharp increases in shortterm interest rates and continued volatility in both financial and physical markets As an example three of our five busiest days in the history of our business in terms of transactional volume occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 principally due to the Ukraine conflict  with the other two days occurring during the initial onset of the Covid pandemic in fiscal 2020 Almost two years ago in the middle of the Covid pandemic we concluded the acquisition of GAIN which was our largest acquisition to date At the outset the rationale for this strategic acquisition was that GAIN\u2019s retail clients would bring additional flow into products we already trade allowing us to combine this new flow with our existing trade flow We would also be able to provide clearing services and additional products that were previously inaccessible to GAIN\u2019s retail clients especially in US markets Furthermore we saw the opportunity for some easy cost synergies \u2013 most of which have been realized  as well as acquiring talented employees especially on the digital marketing side of our business CHIEF EXECUTIVE\u2019S LETTER 1 Share price and market cap data for NASDAQ SNEX ranges from 93002 to 93022 2022 ANNUAL REPORT I 19 Over the last two years our transaction rationale has been validated as GAIN has exceeded the expectations we laid out We effectively executed on all integration objectives and now see retail trading flow as a key part of our franchise In aggregate our average client float for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 was 86 billion up 50 from a year ago This sharp increase was due to growing engagement from existing clients strong organic growth in our client footprint and higher margin rates caused by rising volatility In the wake of 2022\u2019s rate hikes we have experienced an acceleration in interest earnings on client balances up 243 for the full fiscal year versus 2021 with the majority of this growth being recorded in the fourth quarter These significant increases in both product volumes and client float speak to the broadening and deepening of our client base and the validation of our strategy as well as to the continued effort and dedication of our team in expanding the StoneX

strength and resilience but also our continued growth toward becoming a premier global financial services Our record financial performance was broadbased across all products and client segments More details\r\nregarding segment performance and composition can be found on pages 2627\r\nWe have also seen significant strength in the dollar over the past several quarters The majority of our earnings\r\nand variable compensation are denominated in dollars Despite this we have a significant amount of locally\r\ndenominated fixed expenses We believe the strong dollar reduced our 2022 expenses by approximately\r\n20 million when translating our nondollar expenses to dollars for reporting purposes We have entered into\r\ncertain hedging arrangements to continue to lock in this benefit\r\nOur strategy in action\r\nWe believe that our impressive 2022 financial results and our 20year track record of consistent and significant\r\nrevenue growth are directly correlated with our relentless focus on becoming a bestinclass global financial\r\nservices ecosystem\r\nWe have seen an increase in the cadence and delivery of our key projects and many of these are now through\r\nbeta testing and have either been launched or are currently awaiting deployment Our approach is always to\r\nintroduce and market our new capabilities at a steady incremental basis None of these projects in isolation\r\nwill result in a significant change to our current growth trajectory and certain initiatives may not be viable in the\r\nlong run In aggregate however we believe that these initiatives will \u2018bend our growth curve\u2019 upwards As many\r\nof these strategies are digital in nature as they are deployed we believe we will see operational leverage and\r\nscalability start to kick in and experience a steady improvement in margins\r\nTechnology and digitization are recurring themes throughout our strategic objectives set out below While\r\nthe legacy StoneX has traditionally focused on a hightouch approach catering to large commercial and\r\ninstitutional clients we have also ramped up our investment in technology significantly over the last 5 years\r\nThis has allowed us to become innovators by offering our hightouch clients better ways to engage with our\r\necosystem which will in turn make them stickier and more valuable As we accelerate towards a more digital\r\napproach we are engaging a much broader and deeper client base with a significantly larger TAM\r\nIn addition technology allows us to target new client segments where our traditional hightouch approach may\r\nnot be appropriate or costeffective As an example the acquisition of GAIN brought us a selfdirected mobile\r\nplatform focused on highnetworth retail and small professional trading clients This will also result in a more\r\nscalable infrastructure and increased operational leverage which should drive margins In short as we digitize\r\nwe are transforming ourselves into more of a fintech business\r\n2022 was another successful year where we made tremendous headway with each of our four strategic\r\ncompany objectives\r\nBuild our ecosystem \u2013 We must remain relevant to our clients and prospects by adding more of the products\r\nand services they want and by providing them with the best ecosystem possible for accessing the global\r\nfinancial markets Doing so enables us to increase engagement and wallet share from existing clients while\r\nattracting new clients who cannot satisfy their needs elsewhere or who are dissatisfied with how those needs\r\nare being met\r\nIn our securities segment we continued to expand both our product offering as well as our geographic reach\r\nOur securitiesbased revenues have grown by 33 over the last three years On the equities side we launched\r\nour electronic marketmaking capabilities to internalize and capture spread on domestic US equities while\r\nCHIEF EXECUTIVE\u2019S LETTER\r\n2022 ANNUAL REPORT I 21\r\nproviding best execution We are leveraging our longstanding institutional relationships of over 20 years on the\r\ninternational equities side This is a new market opportunity for us which we will ramp up incrementally over the\r\nnext year or so and one which has the potential to be a material source of revenue for the business\r\nOn the fixed income side we have steadily been diversifying into different asset classes to round out our\r\noffering We have started to leverage our capabilities internationally into Europe and Asia with the addition of\r\nkey professional hires to our team We also expanded our capabilities in both regions to support trading and\r\nclearing in a broad range of securities products We believe that we can leverage our broadbased product\r\ncapabilities and trading flows to provide liquidity and execution to clients on an increasingly global basis\r\nWe are planning to launch our cash equities capability to our international selfdirected retail platform in the first\r\nquarter of 2023 allowing clients to seamlessly trade investment products as well as leveraged OTC products\r\nIn the US we will be launching StoneX One which will offer a\r\nmultiasset class mobile trading platform to retail investors\r\nStoneX One will provide our retail clients with a truly\r\nunique crossasset platform with selfdirected execution\r\ncapabilities Initially this will include cash equities options\r\nand futures and will be followed shortly by foreign\r\nexchange cryptocurrency fixed income and precious\r\nmetals All the trading flow will be directed to our electronic\r\nmarketmaking platform which will give us the opportunity\r\nwhere appropriate to internalize spreads In the future we can leverage our wealth management capabilities\r\nby offering roboadvisory portfolio management and even estate planning options for our retail clients\r\nIn Brazil we have started work on our new Digital Pay In \u201cDPI\u201d offering which allows international companies\r\nto collect foreign currency payments from local clients in a digitally efficient way This has significant potential\r\nin Brazil and other jurisdictions and opens up a new and unique payments capability for our existing large\r\ncorporate clients\r\nAs we have done consistently for the last 20 years we continue to ensure that we offer broad access to\r\nproducts markets and exchanges that our clients want to access \u2013 in essence we open markets We\r\ncontinue to innovate and offer new and enhanced OTC hedging products to our clients and have invested in\r\nour technology stack to accomplish this faster and more effectively We are now introducing dozens of new\r\nproducts every month some of which are new and industry leading such as cattle swaps which we introduced\r\ninto Australia in October We have also added several new exchanges and liquidity venues In addition to\r\ngaining incremental revenue these new product offerings position StoneX as a leading innovator focused on\r\nadding value to our clients\r\nGrowdiversify client base \u2013 We are a clientcentric business and strive to grow our client footprint\r\nconsistently by entering new markets expanding market share in our existing markets and adding new client\r\nsegments and channels Our broad range of capabilities enables us to serve clients of nearly every type\r\nwhich creates a large addressable market for us and a significant opportunity for topline growth \u2013 given that\r\nour current market penetration is likely in the single basis point range Seizing this opportunity will enable us to\r\nincrease volume and lower earnings volatilityenterprise Operating revenues rose to a record 21 billion up 26 while net income exceeded 207 million up 78 Shareholder equity eclipsed the billiondollar benchmark for the first time rising to 107 billion For the past two decades our mission at StoneX has been to consistently look for new geographic markets\r\nand increase our product and service offering in turn driving our topline growth\r\nOur securities expansion has seen some early success as we seek to increase our client penetration outside\r\nthe US We are offering our products and capabilities to institutional investors in Europe and Asia where\r\nwe currently have limited market share and thus a large opportunity for client expansion We are currently\r\nbolstering our capabilities in London to enable a more wellrounded offering\r\nOur multiasset class digital trading platforms will substantially expand our retail addressable market and allow\r\nus to capture additional wallet share from existing clients We also plan to leverage these selfdirected trading\r\nplatforms to reach and service smaller agricultural producers specializing in row crops livestock and dairy\r\ndirectly via the Farm Advantage mobile platform This is a compelling opportunity for us to tap into a new and\r\npotentially large client segment\r\nWe have launched our digital payments offering in Brazil for small and mediumsized corporations seeking\r\ninternational payments which will soon be expanded to the US and Europe As we roll out this new platform\r\nwe will add the ability to hedge currencies as well as other products This is significant as it will enable us to\r\nleverage our proven product capabilities for hedging clients into an entirely new client segment Additionally\r\nwe will also be offering this payment capability to all our existing corporate clients further cementing our\r\nrelationships with themEarnings per share diluted were 1001 and we achieved an ROE of 21 despite our equity having increased by 39 over the last two years Over the past 20 years we have compounded operating revenue at 32 per annum and Digitize our business \u2013 We firmly believe that the digitization of client platforms \u2013 backed by highly agile and\r\nefficient infrastructure \u2013 is a key requisite for our continued growth We believe this digitization will enable us\r\nto increase global market share in our massive TAM more efficiently while simultaneously providing scalability\r\nand margin expansion Our keys to this approach are threefold 1 aggregation and ease of access to data\r\nacross the enterprise for strategic use 2 open flexible and modular architecture to enable scalability and 3\r\nopportunities for trade internalization across platforms that benefit our clients via better pricing and improve\r\nour bottom line via higher margins\r\nWe have made significant investments to develop a more efficient and scalable technology stack that enables\r\na faster cadence in delivering digital solutions for our clients These capabilities and platforms will be powered\r\nby our digital marketing team to drive adoption and increase incremental revenue\r\nWe have several projects underway which will make our internal processes more efficient and scalable\r\nallowing us to realize some operational leverage and margin expansion as we continue to grow Most of these\r\ninitiatives are underpinned by our \u201cdata lake\u201d project This allows us to access all data centrally and in real time\r\nfrom our many systems of record where the information is stored and normalized This dramatically reduces\r\nthe endtoend connections required by our functional areas to get a full view of client activity and generates\r\none place to obtain all relevant information\r\nWe continue to see this data being leveraged by several business segments to quickly deploy technology\r\nsolutions and better manage our operations Our risk management process has been enhanced and we now\r\nhave realtime monitoring capabilities across the business providing superior insight and ability to manage\r\nvolatile market conditions Our global platforms are also accessing this information allowing us to more\r\neffectively launch clientfacing applications During 2022 we substantially completed a multiyear conversion\r\nto a new system for accounting and human resources and are now enjoying some meaningful synergies and\r\nscalability as we continue to grow We have similar projects underway on the compliance and treasury side\r\nof our business which we are looking forward to implementing in the near future We have also introduced a\r\ncontract management system for our legal team a technology to better track and monitor internal audit and\r\noperational risk issues and incremental technology improvements for compliance and KYC monitoring\r\nDuring the year we launched StoneHedge for our grain merchandising clients This platform is deployed\r\nthroughout the client\u2019s enterprise allowing them to price and autohedge grain purchases in real time from the\r\nconvenience of a mobile device This platform is integrated into the client\u2019s enterprise system allowing all data\r\nto be instantly accessed driving efficiencies for the client Our technology division recently became a member\r\nof the SWIFT Partnership Program Membership provides StoneX clients with a direct connection to the SWIFT\r\nAPI platform which provides a new level of endtoend transparency StoneX Global Payments will be the first\r\nbusiness segment to deploy this new functionality with clients having full visibility into the status of their crossborder payments throughout the entire transaction lifecycle\r\nWe continue to deploy advanced technology across our trading businesses to efficiently price markets in a\r\nrapidly expanding product set as well as internalize trade flow to enhance spread capture and better monetize\r\nclient trading flow\r\nAll these initiatives and projects serve to make us a more efficient effective and scalable business\r\n2022 ANNUAL REPORT I 24\r\nCompound capital \u2013 From our earliest days we have focused on expanding our capital base by maintaining\r\nconsistent profitability and reinvesting those profits back into the business so that we can create our own\r\ncapital runway for growth We strive to deploy this capital wisely through a disciplined MA approach focused\r\non deals that will accrete immediately to earnings and by making allocation decisions focused on ROE We\r\nbelieve this approach has been key to our ability to achieve stable and consistent growth and we will continue\r\nto pursue it going forward\r\nIn fiscal 2022 we achieved an adjusted ROE of 21 significantly above our 15 target Additionally over the\r\npast ten years we have tripled our shareholder funds and completed over 20 acquisitions to strengthen our\r\nbusiness and expand our global client footprint This has all been achieved with a negligible increase in our\r\nissued share count as

to\r\nensure our robust growth continues\r\nWe have validated our acquisition of GAIN through our results\r\nso far and have significantly expanded our footprint client reach and product offering\r\nWe have made large investments in technology over the last five years to put in place the foundations required\r\nto accelerate the digitization of our business As we continue to implement

advisors for their guidance our bankers for their financial support and our shareholders for\r\nentrusting their capital to us increased from 064 to 8294 \u2013 a gain of approximately 130 times1 Our robust 2022 financial results are a direct validation of the value of our client offering and our ongoing commitment to providing global market access institutionalgrade platforms and technology deep expertise and hightouch service We are continuously investing in our products and services and expanding our capabilities in areas where we can increase our market share We have an enormous total addressable market \u201cTAM\u201d in front of us which presents a significant opportunity for us to further develop our suite of services which we believe will further scale our business in 2023 and beyond Overview Fiscal 2022 was a year of exceptional growth and progress toward our longterm strategic objectives which include digitizing our offerings expanding our client base and building our global financial ecosystem We were pleased to see broadbased doubledigit revenue growth across all of our products and client segments with our business benefiting significantly from the effects of inflationary pressures on the global markets sharp increases in shortterm interest rates and continued volatility in both financial and physical markets As an example three of our five busiest days in the history of our business in terms of transactional volume occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 principally due to the Ukraine conflict  with the other two days occurring during the initial onset of the Covid pandemic in fiscal 2020 Almost two years ago in the middle of the Covid pandemic we concluded the acquisition of GAIN which was our largest acquisition to date At the outset the rationale for this strategic acquisition was that GAIN\u2019s retail clients would bring additional flow into products we already trade allowing us to combine this new flow with our existing trade flow We would also be able to provide clearing services and additional products that were previously inaccessible to GAIN\u2019s retail clients especially in US markets Furthermore we saw the opportunity for some easy cost synergies \u2013 most of which have been realized  as well as acquiring talented employees especially on the digital marketing side of our business CHIEF EXECUTIVE\u2019S LETTER 1 Share price and market cap data for NASDAQ SNEX ranges from 93002 to 93022 2022 ANNUAL REPORT I 19 Over the last two years our transaction rationale has been validated as GAIN has exceeded the expectations we laid out We effectively executed on all integration objectives and now see retail trading flow as a key part of our franchise In aggregate our average client float for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 was 86 billion up 50 from a year ago This sharp increase was due to growing engagement from existing clients strong organic growth in our client footprint and higher margin rates caused by rising volatility In the wake of 2022\u2019s rate hikes we have experienced an acceleration in interest earnings on client balances up 243 for the full fiscal year versus 2021 with the majority of this growth being recorded in the fourth quarter These significant increases in both product volumes and client float speak to the broadening and deepening of our client base and the validation of our strategy as well as to the continued effort and dedication of our team in expanding the StoneX

STANLEY\r\nBALANCED BUSINESS MODEL\r\nTO DRIVE LONGTERM GROWTH\r\nThe strategic decisions we made over the past decade\r\nhave transformed Morgan Stanley\u2019s business model\r\nWe now derive half of our pretax profit from Wealth\r\nand Investment Management and we expect they\r\nwill become an increasingly larger driver of the Firm\u2019s\r\npretax profit in the future This provides stability\r\nthat will be further enhanced as we continue to grow\r\nour client assets while our preeminent Institutional\r\nSecurities franchise will continue to be a driver of\r\nincremental revenue particularly in active markets\r\nWe have built unique competitive advantages\r\naround each of our businesses and have significant\r\nopportunities to maximize growth in the years ahead\r\nOur Wealth and Investment Management businesses\r\ntogether held 55 trillion in client assets at the end of\r\n2022 We have significant scale advantages in these\r\nbusinesses and our longerterm goal is to grow these\r\nassets to 10 trillion The earnings power underlining\r\nthese businesses will serve as an economic engine\r\nfor the Firm for a long time\r\nWe are confident in the longterm value proposition\r\nof the Firm and remain committed to the goals we\r\noutlined a year ago including an ROTCE goal of 20\r\nthrough business cycles We also added a new goal\r\nthis year in Wealth Management for net new assets\r\nthat I outlined earlier With a constructive outlook and\r\nthe proven track record we have delivered thus far\r\nwe fully expect to achieve our goals over time\r\nINVESTING IN OUR PEOPLE AND TALENT\r\nOur future growth and longterm success will also\r\nbe driven by the depth of talent across our Firm and\r\na strong culture that guides our employees Investing\r\nin broadening the diversity of our employeesleadership we have across our organization broaden the diversity of this talent and strengthen our culture of accountability collaboration and inclusion The senior management team is strong and experienced and our and continuing to reinforce our culture remain\r\nimportant objectives for our Board of Directors and\r\nmanagement teams across the world\r\nWe have strong executive leadership and management\r\nacross our business and infrastructure organizations\r\nIn addition we are growing the generation of talent\r\nneeded in the next 10 and 20 years and are deeply\r\ncommitted to investing in them and their success\r\nOver the past year we continued to add responsibilities\r\nto members of the executive leadership team to\r\nbroaden their management experience giving\r\nthem more opportunities to develop and showcase\r\ntheir capabilities\r\nMore recently a handful of seasoned executives on\r\nour Operating Committee have stepped aside either\r\nto pursue new roles in the organization or to pursue\r\nother opportunities Shelley O\u2019Connor the Firm\u2019s Head\r\nof External Affairs announced last summer that she\r\nwould retire from the Firm Franck Petitgas announced\r\nthat he would step down from his role as Head of\r\nMorgan Stanley International to become a Senior\r\nAdvisor Jon Pruzan our Chief Operating Officer and\r\nformer Chief Financial Officer announced his\r\nretirement from the Firm to pursue opportunities\r\noutside the organization Each of these individuals is\r\na longserving senior leader who represents the best\r\nof our Firm and our culture But after years of relative\r\nstability amongst our broader management team\r\nsuch change is positive as it provides opportunities\r\nfor other talented leaders to broaden their\r\nmanagement capabilities\r\nFor example with Shelley O\u2019Connor\u2019s retirement our\r\nChief Legal Officer Eric Grossman was also made\r\nChief Administrative

one of these internal candidates to replace\r\nme when I step down\r\nBuilding an increasingly diverse workforce across\r\nthe entire organization remains central to our\r\nvalues and we continue to

delivered its best annual result in over a decade as clients increased engagement in response to central banks\u2019 ratehiking cycle Institutional Securities is a top three global leader in the industry as demonstrated by wallet share We remain a leader in Equity and Investment Banking and have steadily rebuilt our Fixed Income franchise to focus on our strongest capabilities Scale in our global businesses has been the foundation for gaining market share and our competitive position is strong We have demonstrated our ability to defend share and gain it in relatively more capitallight businesses We also remain disciplined in our risk management and are appropriately careful with our resources managing our riskweighted assets and keeping our GSIB surcharge consistent over three years Wealth Management demonstrated strong growth in 2022 delivering record revenues of 244 billion and a pretax margin of 270 While our total client assets declined to 42 trillion at the end of the year we brought in 311 billion of net new assets in a very volatile market environment with most major indices down about 20 or more Our business continues to benefit from strong client demand across the platform and asset generation across all our channels is supporting this growth Net interest income benefited from higher Federal Funds rates and the investments in expanded bank offerings for our clients With the top advisorled business in the industry complemented by leading workplace and selfdirected offerings the wealth franchise we have built is in a category of one reflecting the combination of bestinclass advice and bestinclass technology We have leadership positions in each of these channels The development of the selfdirected and workplace FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND BUSINESS REVIEW 2022 was marked by an extraordinary set of events not seen in decades putting our business model to the test We started the year with the tail end of the global pandemic and significant geopolitical turmoil US inflation reached a 40year high and other global economies also experienced a rapid increase in prices The Federal Reserve responded with the fastest rate increases in decades The combined impact of persistent inflation and rapid central bank tightening pressured asset levels and hit investor sentiment leading to very little new strategic activity and capital raising Amidst this difficult backdrop Morgan Stanley delivered strong results and produced a return on average tangible common equity ROTCE of 153 for the full year The Firm reported annual net revenues of 537 billion and net income of 110 billion \u2014 the second highest in our history The integrated investment bank \u2014 our Institutional Securities businesses \u2014 delivered revenues of 244 billion last year Our Investment Banking revenues James P Gorman Chairman and CEO 2023 SHAREHOLDER LETTER 3 channels was a concerted strategic shift enabling us to meet any client wherever they are in their wealth accumulation journey and become their wealth management firm of choice We have 18 million relationships across these channels with the potential to deepen those relationships further and consolidate client assets onto our platform Over the last three years we grew net new assets by nearly 1 trillion Our sources of net new assets are well diversified and include new and existing clients selfdirected assets stock plan vesting and net recruiting with no single source exceeding a 25 contribution Given the scale and reach of our business we expect to deliver 1 trillion in net new assets every three years going forward assuming normal market appreciation consistent with historical performance Our workplace channel is an important driver of consolidating assets onto our platform and it continues to bring new relationships to the Firm We have executed our strategy to deepen these relationships and have reached our goals to provide companion accounts to 90 of US participants and to achieve 30 retention of stock plan vested assets From 2020 through the end of 2022 we have already seen flows of approximately 150 billion migrate to the advicebased channel that originated from a workplace relationship A portion of these assets are the stock plan vested balances but a larger portion is from assets held away As we deliver our full suite of capabilities our strategy to

STANLEY\r\nBALANCED BUSINESS MODEL\r\nTO DRIVE LONGTERM GROWTH\r\nThe strategic decisions we made over the past decade\r\nhave transformed Morgan Stanley\u2019s business model\r\nWe now derive half of our pretax profit from Wealth\r\nand Investment Management and we expect they\r\nwill become an increasingly larger driver of the Firm\u2019s\r\npretax profit in the future This provides stability\r\nthat will be further enhanced as we continue to grow\r\nour client assets while our preeminent Institutional\r\nSecurities franchise will continue to be a driver of\r\nincremental revenue particularly in active markets\r\nWe have built unique competitive advantages\r\naround each of our businesses and have significant\r\nopportunities to maximize growth in the years ahead\r\nOur Wealth and Investment Management businesses\r\ntogether held 55 trillion in client assets at the end of\r\n2022 We have significant scale advantages in these\r\nbusinesses and our longerterm goal is to grow these\r\nassets to 10 trillion The earnings power underlining\r\nthese businesses will serve as an economic engine\r\nfor the Firm for a long time\r\nWe are confident in the longterm value proposition\r\nof the Firm and remain committed to the goals we\r\noutlined a year ago including an ROTCE goal of 20\r\nthrough business cycles We also added a new goal\r\nthis year in Wealth Management for net new assets\r\nthat I outlined earlier With a constructive outlook and\r\nthe proven track record we have delivered thus far\r\nwe fully expect to achieve our goals over time\r\nINVESTING IN OUR PEOPLE AND TALENT\r\nOur future growth and longterm success will also\r\nbe driven by the depth of talent across our Firm and\r\na strong culture that guides our employees Investing\r\nin broadening the diversity of our employeesleadership we have across our organization broaden the diversity of this talent and strengthen our culture of accountability collaboration and inclusion The senior management team is strong and experienced and our and continuing to reinforce our culture remain\r\nimportant objectives for our Board of Directors and\r\nmanagement teams across the world\r\nWe have strong executive leadership and management\r\nacross our business and infrastructure organizations\r\nIn addition we are growing the generation of talent\r\nneeded in the next 10 and 20 years and are deeply\r\ncommitted to investing in them and their success\r\nOver the past year we continued to add responsibilities\r\nto members of the executive leadership team to\r\nbroaden their management experience giving\r\nthem more opportunities to develop and showcase\r\ntheir capabilities\r\nMore recently a handful of seasoned executives on\r\nour Operating Committee have stepped aside either\r\nto pursue new roles in the organization or to pursue\r\nother opportunities Shelley O\u2019Connor the Firm\u2019s Head\r\nof External Affairs announced last summer that she\r\nwould

and\r\nformer Chief Financial Officer announced his\r\nretirement from the Firm to pursue opportunities\r\noutside the organization Each of these individuals is\r\na longserving senior leader who represents the best\r\nof our Firm and our culture But after years of relative\r\nstability amongst our broader management team\r\nsuch change is positive as it provides opportunities\r\nfor other talented leaders to broaden their\r\nmanagement capabilities\r\nFor example with Shelley O\u2019Connor\u2019s retirement our\r\nChief Legal Officer Eric Grossman was also made\r\nChief Administrative

industry as demonstrated by wallet share We remain a leader in Equity and Investment Banking and have steadily rebuilt our Fixed Income franchise to focus on our strongest capabilities Scale in our global businesses has been the foundation for gaining market share and our competitive position is strong We have demonstrated our ability to defend share and gain it in relatively more capitallight businesses We also remain disciplined in our risk management and are appropriately careful with our resources managing our riskweighted assets and keeping our GSIB surcharge consistent over three years Wealth Management demonstrated strong growth in 2022 delivering record revenues of 244 billion and a pretax margin of 270 While our total client assets declined to 42 trillion at the end of the year we brought in 311 billion of net new assets in a very volatile market environment with most major indices down about 20 or more Our business continues to benefit from strong client demand across the platform and asset generation across all our channels is supporting this growth Net interest income benefited from higher Federal Funds rates and the investments in expanded bank offerings for our clients With the top advisorled business in the industry complemented by leading workplace and selfdirected offerings the wealth franchise we have built is in a category of one reflecting the

REVIEW 2022 was marked by an extraordinary set of events not seen in decades putting our business model to the test We started the year with the tail end of the global pandemic and significant geopolitical turmoil US inflation reached a 40year high and other global economies also experienced a rapid increase in prices The Federal Reserve responded with the fastest rate increases in decades The combined impact of persistent inflation and rapid central bank tightening pressured asset levels and hit investor sentiment leading to very little new strategic activity and capital raising Amidst this difficult backdrop Morgan Stanley delivered strong results and produced a return on average tangible common equity ROTCE of 153 for the full year The Firm reported annual net revenues of 537 billion and net income of 110 billion \u2014 the second highest in our history The integrated investment bank \u2014 our Institutional Securities businesses \u2014 delivered revenues of 244 billion

wealth accumulation journey and become their wealth management firm of choice We have 18 million relationships across these channels with the potential to deepen those relationships further and consolidate client assets onto our platform Over the last three years we grew net new assets by nearly 1 trillion Our sources of net new assets are well diversified and include new and existing clients selfdirected assets stock plan vesting and net recruiting with no single source exceeding a 25 contribution Given the scale and reach of our business we expect to deliver 1 trillion in net new assets every three years going forward assuming normal market appreciation consistent with historical performance Our workplace channel is an important driver of consolidating assets onto our platform and it continues to bring new relationships to the Firm We have executed our strategy to deepen these relationships and have reached our goals to provide companion accounts to 90 of US participants and to achieve 30 retention of stock plan vested assets From 2020 through the end of 2022 we have already seen flows of approximately 150 billion migrate to the advicebased channel that originated from a workplace relationship A portion of these assets are the stock plan vested balances but a larger portion is from assets held away As we deliver our full suite of capabilities our strategy to

STANLEY\r\nBALANCED BUSINESS MODEL\r\nTO DRIVE LONGTERM GROWTH\r\nThe strategic decisions we made over the past decade\r\nhave transformed Morgan Stanley\u2019s business model\r\nWe now derive half of our pretax profit from Wealth\r\nand Investment Management and we expect they\r\nwill become an increasingly larger driver of the Firm\u2019s\r\npretax profit in the future This provides stability\r\nthat will be further enhanced as we continue to grow\r\nour client assets while our preeminent Institutional\r\nSecurities franchise will continue to be a driver of\r\nincremental revenue particularly in active markets\r\nWe have built unique competitive advantages\r\naround each of our businesses and have significant\r\nopportunities to maximize growth in the years ahead\r\nOur Wealth and Investment Management businesses\r\ntogether held 55 trillion in client assets at the end of\r\n2022 We have significant scale advantages in these\r\nbusinesses and our longerterm goal is to grow these\r\nassets to 10 trillion The earnings power underlining\r\nthese businesses will serve as an economic engine\r\nfor the Firm for a long time\r\nWe are confident in the longterm value proposition\r\nof the Firm and remain committed to the goals we\r\noutlined a year ago including an ROTCE goal of 20\r\nthrough business cycles We also added a new goal\r\nthis year in Wealth Management for net new assets\r\nthat I outlined earlier With a constructive outlook and\r\nthe proven track record we have delivered thus far\r\nwe fully expect to achieve our goals over time\r\nINVESTING IN OUR PEOPLE AND TALENT\r\nOur future growth and longterm success will also\r\nbe driven by the depth of talent across our Firm and\r\na strong culture that guides our employees Investing\r\nin broadening the diversity of our employeesleadership we have across our organization broaden the diversity of this talent and strengthen our culture of accountability collaboration and inclusion The senior management team is strong and experienced and our and continuing to reinforce our culture remain\r\nimportant objectives for our Board of Directors and\r\nmanagement teams across the world\r\nWe have strong executive leadership and management\r\nacross our business and infrastructure organizations\r\nIn addition we are growing the generation of talent\r\nneeded in the next 10 and 20 years and are deeply\r\ncommitted to investing in them and their success\r\nOver the past year we continued to add responsibilities\r\nto members of the executive leadership team to\r\nbroaden their management experience giving\r\nthem more opportunities to develop and showcase\r\ntheir capabilities\r\nMore recently a handful of seasoned executives on\r\nour Operating Committee have stepped aside either\r\nto pursue new roles in the organization or to pursue\r\nother opportunities Shelley O\u2019Connor the Firm\u2019s Head\r\nof External Affairs announced last summer that she\r\nwould

and\r\nformer Chief Financial Officer announced his\r\nretirement from the Firm to pursue opportunities\r\noutside the organization Each of these individuals is\r\na longserving senior leader who represents the best\r\nof our Firm and our culture But after years of relative\r\nstability amongst our broader management team\r\nsuch change is positive as it provides opportunities\r\nfor other talented leaders to broaden their\r\nmanagement capabilities\r\nFor example with Shelley O\u2019Connor\u2019s retirement our\r\nChief Legal Officer Eric Grossman was also made\r\nChief Administrative

industry as demonstrated by wallet share We remain a leader in Equity and Investment Banking and have steadily rebuilt our Fixed Income franchise to focus on our strongest capabilities Scale in our global businesses has been the foundation for gaining market share and our competitive position is strong We have demonstrated our ability to defend share and gain it in relatively more capitallight businesses We also remain disciplined in our risk management and are appropriately careful with our resources managing our riskweighted assets and keeping our GSIB surcharge consistent over three years Wealth Management demonstrated strong growth in 2022 delivering record revenues of 244 billion and a pretax margin of 270 While our total client assets declined to 42 trillion at the end of the year we brought in 311 billion of net new assets in a very volatile market environment with most major indices down about 20 or more Our business continues to benefit from strong client demand across the platform and asset generation across all our channels is supporting this growth Net interest income benefited from higher Federal Funds rates and the investments in expanded bank offerings for our clients With the top advisorled business in the industry complemented by leading workplace and selfdirected offerings the wealth franchise we have built is in a category of one reflecting the

REVIEW 2022 was marked by an extraordinary set of events not seen in decades putting our business model to the test We started the year with the tail end of the global pandemic and significant geopolitical turmoil US inflation reached a 40year high and other global economies also experienced a rapid increase in prices The Federal Reserve responded with the fastest rate increases in decades The combined impact of persistent inflation and rapid central bank tightening pressured asset levels and hit investor sentiment leading to very little new strategic activity and capital raising Amidst this difficult backdrop Morgan Stanley delivered strong results and produced a return on average tangible common equity ROTCE of 153 for the full year The Firm reported annual net revenues of 537 billion and net income of 110 billion \u2014 the second highest in our history The integrated investment bank \u2014 our Institutional Securities businesses \u2014 delivered revenues of 244 billion

wealth accumulation journey and become their wealth management firm of choice We have 18 million relationships across these channels with the potential to deepen those relationships further and consolidate client assets onto our platform Over the last three years we grew net new assets by nearly 1 trillion Our sources of net new assets are well diversified and include new and existing clients selfdirected assets stock plan vesting and net recruiting with no single source exceeding a 25 contribution Given the scale and reach of our business we expect to deliver 1 trillion in net new assets every three years going forward assuming normal market appreciation consistent with historical performance Our workplace channel is an important driver of consolidating assets onto our platform and it continues to bring new relationships to the Firm We have executed our strategy to deepen these relationships and have reached our goals to provide companion accounts to 90 of US participants and to achieve 30 retention of stock plan vested assets From 2020 through the end of 2022 we have already seen flows of approximately 150 billion migrate to the advicebased channel that originated from a workplace relationship A portion of these assets are the stock plan vested balances but a larger portion is from assets held away As we deliver our full suite of capabilities our strategy to

STANLEY\r\nBALANCED BUSINESS MODEL\r\nTO DRIVE LONGTERM GROWTH\r\nThe strategic decisions we made over the past decade\r\nhave transformed Morgan Stanley\u2019s business model\r\nWe now derive half of our pretax profit from Wealth\r\nand Investment Management and we expect they\r\nwill become an increasingly larger driver of the Firm\u2019s\r\npretax profit in the future This provides stability\r\nthat will be further enhanced as we continue to grow\r\nour client assets while our preeminent Institutional\r\nSecurities franchise will continue to be a driver of\r\nincremental revenue particularly in active markets\r\nWe have built unique competitive advantages\r\naround each of our businesses and have significant\r\nopportunities to maximize growth in the years ahead\r\nOur Wealth and Investment Management businesses\r\ntogether held 55 trillion in client assets at the end of\r\n2022 We have significant scale advantages in these\r\nbusinesses and our longerterm goal is to grow these\r\nassets to 10 trillion The earnings power underlining\r\nthese businesses will serve as an economic engine\r\nfor the Firm for a long time\r\nWe are confident in the longterm value proposition\r\nof the Firm and remain committed to the goals we\r\noutlined a year ago including an ROTCE goal of 20\r\nthrough business cycles We also added a new goal\r\nthis year in Wealth Management for net new assets\r\nthat I outlined earlier With a constructive outlook and\r\nthe proven track record we have delivered thus far\r\nwe fully expect to achieve our goals over time\r\nINVESTING IN OUR PEOPLE AND TALENT\r\nOur future growth and longterm success will also\r\nbe driven by the depth of talent across our Firm and\r\na strong culture that guides our employees Investing\r\nin broadening the diversity of our employeesleadership we have across our organization broaden the diversity of this talent and strengthen our culture of accountability collaboration and inclusion The senior management team is strong and experienced and our and continuing to reinforce our culture remain\r\nimportant objectives for our Board of Directors and\r\nmanagement teams across the world\r\nWe have strong executive leadership and management\r\nacross our business and infrastructure organizations\r\nIn addition we are growing the generation of talent\r\nneeded in the next 10 and 20 years and are deeply\r\ncommitted to investing in them and their success\r\nOver the past year we continued to add responsibilities\r\nto members of the executive leadership team to\r\nbroaden their management experience giving\r\nthem more opportunities to develop and showcase\r\ntheir capabilities\r\nMore recently a handful of seasoned executives on\r\nour Operating Committee have stepped aside either\r\nto pursue new roles in the organization or to pursue\r\nother opportunities Shelley O\u2019Connor the Firm\u2019s Head\r\nof External Affairs announced last summer that she\r\nwould

and\r\nformer Chief Financial Officer announced his\r\nretirement from the Firm to pursue opportunities\r\noutside the organization Each of these individuals is\r\na longserving senior leader who represents the best\r\nof our Firm and our culture But after years of relative\r\nstability amongst our broader management team\r\nsuch change is positive as it provides opportunities\r\nfor other talented leaders to broaden their\r\nmanagement capabilities\r\nFor example with Shelley O\u2019Connor\u2019s retirement our\r\nChief Legal Officer Eric Grossman was also made\r\nChief Administrative

industry as demonstrated by wallet share We remain a leader in Equity and Investment Banking and have steadily rebuilt our Fixed Income franchise to focus on our strongest capabilities Scale in our global businesses has been the foundation for gaining market share and our competitive position is strong We have demonstrated our ability to defend share and gain it in relatively more capitallight businesses We also remain disciplined in our risk management and are appropriately careful with our resources managing our riskweighted assets and keeping our GSIB surcharge consistent over three years Wealth Management demonstrated strong growth in 2022 delivering record revenues of 244 billion and a pretax margin of 270 While our total client assets declined to 42 trillion at the end of the year we brought in 311 billion of net new assets in a very volatile market environment with most major indices down about 20 or more Our business continues to benefit from strong client demand across the platform and asset generation across all our channels is supporting this growth Net interest income benefited from higher Federal Funds rates and the investments in expanded bank offerings for our clients With the top advisorled business in the industry complemented by leading workplace and selfdirected offerings the wealth franchise we have built is in a category of one reflecting the

REVIEW 2022 was marked by an extraordinary set of events not seen in decades putting our business model to the test We started the year with the tail end of the global pandemic and significant geopolitical turmoil US inflation reached a 40year high and other global economies also experienced a rapid increase in prices The Federal Reserve responded with the fastest rate increases in decades The combined impact of persistent inflation and rapid central bank tightening pressured asset levels and hit investor sentiment leading to very little new strategic activity and capital raising Amidst this difficult backdrop Morgan Stanley delivered strong results and produced a return on average tangible common equity ROTCE of 153 for the full year The Firm reported annual net revenues of 537 billion and net income of 110 billion \u2014 the second highest in our history The integrated investment bank \u2014 our Institutional Securities businesses \u2014 delivered revenues of 244 billion

wealth accumulation journey and become their wealth management firm of choice We have 18 million relationships across these channels with the potential to deepen those relationships further and consolidate client assets onto our platform Over the last three years we grew net new assets by nearly 1 trillion Our sources of net new assets are well diversified and include new and existing clients selfdirected assets stock plan vesting and net recruiting with no single source exceeding a 25 contribution Given the scale and reach of our business we expect to deliver 1 trillion in net new assets every three years going forward assuming normal market appreciation consistent with historical performance Our workplace channel is an important driver of consolidating assets onto our platform and it continues to bring new relationships to the Firm We have executed our strategy to deepen these relationships and have reached our goals to provide companion accounts to 90 of US participants and to achieve 30 retention of stock plan vested assets From 2020 through the end of 2022 we have already seen flows of approximately 150 billion migrate to the advicebased channel that originated from a workplace relationship A portion of these assets are the stock plan vested balances but a larger portion is from assets held away As we deliver our full suite of capabilities our strategy to

and consistency Our growth is accelerating our confidence is growing and our company is gaining momentum The reasons for this are clear Our clients and partners are facing a series of specific business challenges inflation supply chain disruption tight labor markets sustainability requirements and an everevolving cybersecurity threat landscape They recognize technology as a source of competitive advantage capable of addressing these immediate issues and futureproofing their businesses by increasing productivity reducing costs driving innovation and fueling growth To that end we have sharpened our focus on IBM\u2019s unique ability to integrate technology and business expertise for our clients and our partners Our portfolio is built around hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence AI the two most transformational technologies of our time And our gotomarket approach brings together the necessary software consulting and infrastructure our clients require from across our expanding ecosystem of partners This is today\u2019s IBM 2022 Performance For the year IBM generated 605 billion in revenue and 93 billion of free cash flow Our focus on delivering client value fueled revenue growth of 12 at constant currency in 2022 including about four points from incremental external sales to Kyndryl Our solid and growing recurring revenue base now represents more than 50 of IBM\u2019s total revenue And today more than 70 of our annual revenue is in Software and Consulting IBM 2022 Annual Report 1 IBM Software revenues were up 12 at constant currency including about 6 points from incremental sales to Kyndryl Red Hat which allows clients to harness the power of opensource software innovations continues to grow at a healthy rate Our automation data and AI and security software have been optimized for this platform and delivered solid growth IBM Consulting revenues were up 15 at constant currency driven by clients\u2019 strong demand for our extensive technical and business expertise to accelerate their digital transformation journeys IBM Infrastructure revenues were up 14 at constant currency including about 6 points from incremental sales to Kyndryl Clients continue to leverage IBM zSystems and Distributed Infrastructure platforms as foundational elements of their hybrid cloud infrastructure This revenue growth and cash generation allowed for both continued investment in the business and shareholder returns In 2022 we spent more than 2 billion to acquire eight companies and returned nearly 6 billion to stockholders through dividends Technology and expertise Our perspective on technology is clear and consistent hybrid cloud and AI are helping to usher in a new era of greater productivity faster insights better decisionmaking and enhanced employee and customer experiences That is why we have designed our products and services to maximize the business value of hybrid cloud and AI for our clients Hybrid cloud has become the leading architecture for enterprises because it offers more value than relying on a single public cloud This value takes the form of scale security ease of use flexibility seamless experiences and faster innovation cycles Companies continue to adopt hybrid cloud to unify their data and applications across multiple clouds on premise and at the edge Containers are the preferred destination for hybrid cloud applications and IBM\u2019s container platform with Red Hat at the core continues to gain clients For example the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce CIBC adopted a hybrid cloud approach that uses Red Hat technology to manage and scale its infrastructure with greater speed and flexibility As a result they delivered hundreds of new applications while reducing provisioning time by 95 and deployment time by 50 They join organizations like Bharti Airtel Charles Schwab Samsung Electronics and the US Department of Education in working with IBM to realize the value of hybrid cloud These powerful hybrid cloud environments also allow clients to infuse AI across their business operations AI is expected to unlock 16 trillion in value from the global economy by 2030 \u2013 including massive boosts in productivity \u2013 by scaling datadriven insight and automating business workflows in everything from IT operations and financial reporting to human resources and customer service Examples include IBM\u2019s work with McDonald\u2019s to automate the drivethru experience with AI at scale We also partnered with the US Department of Veterans Affairs to automate the 2 IBM Software IBM Consulting IBM Infrastructure delivery of pension benefits accelerating the claims process and freeing up VA staff to focus on higher value work And BBC Studios is now using our AIOps software to automate the management of its IT infrastructure To help power hybrid cloud environments and the AI that runs on them IBM introduced the z16 platform with an integrated onchip AI accelerator specifically designed to process and analyze realtime transactions at scale We also unveiled IBM\u2019s next generation LinuxONE servers which help clients dramatically reduce data center energy consumption in support of their sustainability goals IBM Consulting\u2019s business and industry expertise brings these offerings to life for our clients helping them modernize and manage their applications in a hybrid cloud environment automate their workflows with data and AI and meet their security and regulatory requirements IBM Consulting has strengthened its commitment to be a trusted partner for digital transformation and expanded its use of the IBM Garage \u2013 an agile approach to cocreating with clients \u2013 with more than 6700 IBM Garage engagements during the year For example IBM Consulting is cocreating with Discover developing solutions for migrating its systems and applications to an open and flexible hybrid cloud architecture with Red Hat OpenShift As a result Discover can automate key business processes and deliver solutions more quickly improving its customer experience and advancing its overall digital transformation To complement these offerings IBM made eight acquisitions in 2022 We added software and consulting capabilities to address specific client challenges including environmental performance management software Envizi cybersecurity attack surface management Randori and digital transformation services for the US federal government Octo Client engagement Partnership and cocreation IBM continues to embrace our partner ecosystem as a strategic advantage in delivering value to our clients In 2022 we made significant progress in bolstering these partnerships including the introduction of a new skills program to equip partners with the same training and enablement as IBMers at no cost The increasing value of our partner ecosystem \u2013 to our company our clients and the partners themselves \u2013 is evident Business with our strategic partners continues to grow with SAP Microsoft and AWS all over 1 billion in revenue for the year We partnered with Amazon Web Services to deliver IBM software as a service on the AWS Marketplace Our partnership with Microsoft expanded in 2022 with 30 IBM solutions now available on the Microsoft Marketplace and deployable on Microsoft Azure Meanwhile Adobe and Salesforce are now leveraging opensource innovation based on Red Hat technologies in their offerings To ensure clients engage with IBM and its partners simply and efficiently we made significant changes to our gotomarket model in 2022 and improved our sales productivity The IBM Sales and IBM Ecosystem functions joined together to create a single coordinated unit focused on a distinct set of sales plays deeper technical engagement and a more experiential approach to selling built around IBM Garages Innovation Studios and Client Engineering teams Exploratory research and applied science IBM Research is driven by our longstanding mission to define the future of computing Our investments span multiple time horizons and range across all of IBM\u2019s businesses maintaining a careful balance between exploratory research and applied science In 2022 IBM Research focused its talent and resources on innovation with practical application particularly in the areas of hybrid cloud data and AI automation security semiconductors and quantum computing For example the IBM Telum Processor features onchip acceleration for AI inferencing in realtime Today it powers the AI capabilities of the IBM z16 allowing clients to identify fraud at scale in milliseconds We also pioneered breakthrough innovation in the AI field of large language and foundational models Project Wisdom for Red Hat Ansible uses foundational AI models to enable developers to generate highquality code using plain English across multiple clouds IBM Research \u2013 like the rest of the company \u2013 has embraced partnership and open innovation as it works to solve the most urgent problems of business and society While we continue to build and maintain a valuable portfolio of intellectual property we understand that open collaboration with clients partners and even competitors can accelerate the realization of value IBM\u2019s work in quantum computing is a good example of how we blend proprietary and open innovation In November we again advanced the fundamental science of quantum computing unveiling the 433 qubit IBM Osprey processor This will help us move forward on our roadmap to deliver a 1000plus qubit system this year and a 4000plus qubit system in 2025 Our IBM Quantum Network has more than 200 members with companies like Boeing HSBC and Mitsubishi Chemical pursuing potentially industrychanging research Meanwhile we continue to provide access to IBM 2022 Annual Report 3 quantum capability through the cloud More than 15 million people have downloaded the free Qiskit software development kit and an ecosystem of more than 450000 registered users have developed applications and published papers based on our quantum technology Environmental equitable and ethical impact Both internally and in our work with clients IBM aspires to make a lasting positive impact on the world by protecting the environment advocating for inclusion and fostering trust and transparency in both technology and business In 2022 we announced IBM Impact a new framework that reflects our approach to creating a more sustainable equitable and ethical future Using this framework we will continue to set goals measure progress and report our results as part of our culture of accountability We continued to make progress towards our goal of netzero operational greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 In fact we have reduced those emissions by 61 since 2010 We are using IBM Sustainability solutions to simplify and automate our sustainability reporting processes During the year we were recognized by Boston Consulting Group and TIME Magazine for helping clients turn their sustainability ambitions into actions IBM demonstrates its commitment to diversity equity and inclusivity by creating space and opportunity for everyone at IBM and in society at large Our diversity practices have resulted in a yearoveryear increase of representation for women globally and Black and Hispanic employees in the US We are collaborating with more than 20 Historically Black Colleges and Universities on IBM Cybersecurity Centers to advance STEMbased opportunities We also continue to narrow the STEM skills gap with our IBM SkillsBuild initiative adding to our network of 170 partners in our effort to provide access to education and training to 30 million people worldwide by 2030 IBM continues to develop innovation policy and practices that prioritize ethics trust transparency and above all accountability In 2022 we exceeded our goal to train 1000 partners in technology ethics IBM was named to Ethisphere\u2019s list of the most ethical companies in the world for the fourth time Why the world needs IBM and IBMers Today\u2019s IBM is more closely aligned with the needs of our clients Our engagement model is simpler and more effective And we have expanded our ecosystem by strengthening existing relationships and forging new productive partnerships There is of course more to be done Increasing our levels of productivity will be paramount To get there we are infusing our own technology into workflows and processes that span from HR to finance to sales and more We are prioritizing speed and simplicity in our execution while cultivating a highperformance culture designed to ensure every activity is tied to a clear and tangible business outcome I am proud of the progress we have made as a company and the results we have delivered And I am especially proud of the IBMers who have made it possible Because the performance of our business depends entirely on a workforce that is smart committed and inspired That inspiration comes from our belief in the fundamental promise of technology that when we apply innovation to realworld problems we drive progress for both business and society IBMers deliver on that promise every day When we help a pharmacy administer more vaccines When we help reduce the carbon footprint of a retailer Or when we help prevent a cyberattack on a bank Today\u2019s IBM is not simply a technology company We are a problemsolving company and a convener of capability that brings together our colleagues our clients and our partners with a simple open invitation

technical and business expertise to accelerate their digital transformation journeys IBM Infrastructure revenues were up 14 at constant currency including about 6 points from incremental sales to Kyndryl Clients continue to leverage IBM zSystems and Distributed Infrastructure platforms as foundational elements of their hybrid cloud infrastructure This revenue growth and cash generation allowed for both continued investment in the business and shareholder returns In 2022 we spent more than 2 billion to acquire eight companies and returned nearly 6 billion to stockholders through dividends Technology and expertise Our perspective on technology is clear and consistent hybrid cloud and AI are helping to usher in a new era of greater productivity faster insights better decisionmaking and enhanced employee and customer experiences That is why we have designed our products and services to maximize the business value of hybrid cloud and AI for our clients Hybrid cloud has become the leading architecture for enterprises because it offers more value than relying on a single public cloud This value takes the form of scale security ease of use flexibility seamless experiences and faster innovation cycles Companies continue to adopt hybrid cloud to unify their data and applications across multiple clouds on premise and at the edge Containers are the preferred destination for hybrid cloud applications and IBM\u2019s container platform with Red Hat at the core continues to gain clients For example the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce CIBC adopted a hybrid cloud approach that uses Red Hat technology to manage and scale its infrastructure with greater speed and flexibility As a result they delivered hundreds of new applications while reducing provisioning time by 95 and deployment time by 50 They join organizations like Bharti Airtel Charles Schwab Samsung Electronics and the US Department of Education in working with IBM to realize the value of hybrid cloud These powerful hybrid cloud environments also allow clients to infuse AI across their business operations AI is expected to unlock 16 trillion in value from the global economy by 2030 \u2013 including

partner for digital transformation and expanded its use of the IBM Garage \u2013 an agile approach to cocreating with clients \u2013 with more than 6700 IBM Garage engagements during the year For example IBM Consulting is cocreating with Discover developing solutions for migrating its systems and applications to an open and flexible hybrid cloud architecture with Red Hat OpenShift As a result Discover can automate key business processes and deliver solutions more quickly improving its customer experience and advancing its overall digital transformation To complement these offerings IBM made eight acquisitions in 2022 We added software and consulting capabilities to address specific client challenges including environmental performance management software Envizi cybersecurity attack surface management Randori and digital transformation services for the US federal government Octo Client engagement Partnership and cocreation IBM continues to embrace our partner ecosystem as a strategic advantage in delivering value to our clients In 2022 we made significant progress in bolstering these partnerships including the introduction of a new skills program to equip partners with the same training and enablement as IBMers at no cost The increasing value of our partner ecosystem \u2013 to our company our clients and the partners themselves \u2013 is evident Business with our strategic partners continues to grow with SAP Microsoft and AWS all over 1 billion in revenue for the year We partnered with Amazon Web Services to deliver IBM software as a service on the AWS Marketplace Our partnership with Microsoft expanded in 2022 with 30 IBM solutions now available on the Microsoft Marketplace and deployable on Microsoft Azure Meanwhile Adobe and Salesforce are now leveraging opensource innovation based on Red Hat technologies in their offerings To ensure clients engage with IBM and its partners simply and efficiently we made significant changes to our

and practices that prioritize ethics trust transparency and above all accountability In 2022 we exceeded our goal to train 1000 partners in technology ethics IBM was named to Ethisphere\u2019s list of the most ethical companies in the world for the fourth time Why the world needs IBM and IBMers Today\u2019s IBM is more closely aligned with the needs of our clients Our engagement model is simpler and more effective And we have expanded our ecosystem by strengthening existing relationships and forging new productive partnerships There is of course more to be done Increasing our levels of productivity will be paramount To get there we are infusing our own technology into workflows and processes that span from HR to finance to sales and more We are prioritizing speed and simplicity in our execution while cultivating a highperformance culture designed to ensure every activity is tied to a clear and tangible business outcome I am proud of the progress we have made as a company and the results we have delivered And I am especially proud of the IBMers who have made it possible Because the performance of our business depends entirely on a workforce that is smart committed and inspired That inspiration comes from our belief in the fundamental promise of technology that when we apply innovation to realworld problems we drive progress for both business and society IBMers deliver on that promise every day When we help a pharmacy administer more vaccines When we help reduce the carbon footprint of a retailer Or when we help prevent a cyberattack on a bank Today\u2019s

and consistency Our growth is accelerating our confidence is growing and our company is gaining momentum The reasons for this are clear Our clients and partners are facing a series of specific business challenges inflation supply chain disruption tight labor markets sustainability requirements and an everevolving cybersecurity threat landscape They recognize technology as a source of competitive advantage capable of addressing these immediate issues and futureproofing their businesses by increasing productivity reducing costs driving innovation and fueling growth To that end we have sharpened our focus on IBM\u2019s unique ability to integrate technology and business expertise for our clients and our partners Our portfolio is built around hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence AI the two most transformational technologies of our time And our gotomarket approach brings together the necessary software consulting and infrastructure our clients require from across our expanding ecosystem of partners This is today\u2019s IBM 2022 Performance For the year IBM generated 605 billion in revenue and 93 billion of free cash flow Our focus on delivering client value fueled revenue growth of 12 at constant currency in 2022 including about four points from incremental external sales to Kyndryl Our solid and growing recurring revenue base now represents more than 50 of IBM\u2019s total revenue And today more than 70 of our annual revenue is in Software and Consulting IBM 2022 Annual Report 1 IBM Software revenues were up 12 at constant currency including about 6 points from incremental sales to Kyndryl Red Hat which allows clients to harness the power of opensource software innovations continues to grow at a healthy rate Our automation data and AI and security software have been optimized for this platform and delivered solid growth IBM Consulting revenues were up 15 at constant currency driven by clients\u2019 strong demand for our extensive technical and business expertise to accelerate their digital transformation journeys IBM Infrastructure revenues were up 14 at constant currency including about 6 points from incremental sales to Kyndryl Clients continue to leverage IBM zSystems and Distributed Infrastructure platforms as foundational elements of their hybrid cloud infrastructure This revenue growth and cash generation allowed for both continued investment in the business and shareholder returns In 2022 we spent more than 2 billion to acquire eight companies and returned nearly 6 billion to stockholders through dividends Technology and expertise Our perspective on technology is clear and consistent hybrid cloud and AI are helping to usher in a new era of greater productivity faster insights better decisionmaking and enhanced employee and customer experiences That is why we have designed our products and services to maximize the business value of hybrid cloud and AI for our clients Hybrid cloud has become the leading architecture for enterprises because it offers more value than relying on a single public cloud This value takes the form of scale security ease of use flexibility seamless experiences and faster innovation cycles Companies continue to adopt hybrid cloud to unify their data and applications across multiple clouds on premise and at the edge Containers are the preferred destination for hybrid cloud applications and IBM\u2019s container platform with Red Hat at the core continues to gain clients For example the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce CIBC adopted a hybrid cloud approach that uses Red Hat technology to manage and scale its infrastructure with greater speed and flexibility As a result they delivered hundreds of new applications while reducing provisioning time by 95 and deployment time by 50 They join organizations like Bharti Airtel Charles Schwab Samsung Electronics and the US Department of Education in working with IBM to realize the value of hybrid cloud These powerful hybrid cloud environments also allow clients to infuse AI across their business operations AI is expected to unlock 16 trillion in value from the global economy by 2030 \u2013 including massive boosts in productivity \u2013 by scaling datadriven insight and automating business workflows in everything from IT operations and financial reporting to human resources and customer service Examples include IBM\u2019s work with McDonald\u2019s to automate the drivethru experience with AI at scale We also partnered with the US Department of Veterans Affairs to automate the 2 IBM Software IBM Consulting IBM Infrastructure delivery of pension benefits accelerating the claims process and freeing up VA staff to focus on higher value work And BBC Studios is now using our AIOps software to automate the management of its IT infrastructure To help power hybrid cloud environments and the AI that runs on them IBM introduced the z16 platform with an integrated onchip AI accelerator specifically designed to process and analyze realtime transactions at scale We also unveiled IBM\u2019s next generation LinuxONE servers which help clients dramatically reduce data center energy consumption in support of their sustainability goals IBM Consulting\u2019s business and industry expertise brings these offerings to life for our clients helping them modernize and manage their applications in a hybrid cloud environment automate their workflows with data and AI and meet their security and regulatory requirements IBM Consulting has strengthened its commitment to be a trusted partner for digital transformation and expanded its use of the IBM Garage \u2013 an agile approach to cocreating with clients \u2013 with more than 6700 IBM Garage engagements during the year For example IBM Consulting is cocreating with Discover developing solutions for migrating its systems and applications to an open and flexible hybrid cloud architecture with Red Hat OpenShift As a result Discover can automate key business processes and deliver solutions more quickly improving its customer experience and advancing its overall digital transformation To complement these offerings IBM made eight acquisitions in 2022 We added software and consulting capabilities to address specific client challenges including environmental performance management software Envizi cybersecurity attack surface management Randori and digital transformation services for the US federal government Octo Client engagement Partnership and cocreation IBM continues to embrace our partner ecosystem as a strategic advantage in delivering value to our clients In 2022 we made significant progress in bolstering these partnerships including the introduction of a new skills program to equip partners with the same training and enablement as IBMers at no cost The increasing value of our partner ecosystem \u2013 to our company our clients and the partners themselves \u2013 is evident Business with our strategic partners continues to grow with SAP Microsoft and AWS all over 1 billion in revenue for the year We partnered with Amazon Web Services to deliver IBM software as a service on the AWS Marketplace Our partnership with Microsoft expanded in 2022 with 30 IBM solutions now available on the Microsoft Marketplace and deployable on Microsoft Azure Meanwhile Adobe and Salesforce are now leveraging opensource innovation based on Red Hat technologies in their offerings To ensure clients engage with IBM and its partners simply and efficiently we made significant changes to our gotomarket model in 2022 and improved our sales productivity The IBM Sales and IBM Ecosystem functions joined together to create a single coordinated unit focused on a distinct set of sales plays deeper technical engagement and a more experiential approach to selling built around IBM Garages Innovation Studios and Client Engineering teams Exploratory research and applied science IBM Research is driven by our longstanding mission to define the future of computing Our investments span multiple time horizons and range across all of IBM\u2019s businesses maintaining a careful balance between exploratory research and applied science In 2022 IBM Research focused its talent and resources on innovation with practical application particularly in the areas of hybrid cloud data and AI automation security semiconductors and quantum computing For example the IBM Telum Processor features onchip acceleration for AI inferencing in realtime Today it powers the AI capabilities of the IBM z16 allowing clients to identify fraud at scale in milliseconds We also pioneered breakthrough innovation in the AI field of large language and foundational models Project Wisdom for Red Hat Ansible uses foundational AI models to enable developers to generate highquality code using plain English across multiple clouds IBM Research \u2013 like the rest of the company \u2013 has embraced partnership and open innovation as it works to solve the most urgent problems of business and society While we continue to build and maintain a valuable portfolio of intellectual property we understand that open collaboration with clients partners and even competitors can accelerate the realization of value IBM\u2019s work in quantum computing is a good example of how we blend proprietary and open innovation In November we again advanced the fundamental science of quantum computing unveiling the 433 qubit IBM Osprey processor This will help us move forward on our roadmap to deliver a 1000plus qubit system this year and a 4000plus qubit system in 2025 Our IBM Quantum Network has more than 200 members with companies like Boeing HSBC and Mitsubishi Chemical pursuing potentially industrychanging research

updated\r\nclinical system is designed to provide\r\nHCA Healthcare clinicians with an intuitive\r\nmobile user interface personalized to our\r\nworkflows In addition we expect it will allow us\r\nto standardize our data sets more effectively and\r\nutilize cloudbased analytics to support better\r\nclinical decisions improve efficiencies and create\r\na safer environment for our patients\r\nAnd as we continue to innovate and integrate\r\ntechnology into patient care we are partnering\r\nwith organizations that share our common goal\r\nFor example we recently partnered with\r\nMcKesson Corporation to form an oncology\r\nresearch joint venture combining McKessons\r\nUS Oncology Research USOR and\r\nHCA Healthcares Sarah Cannon Research\r\nInstitute SCRI Together USOR and SCRI\r\ncreate a fully integrated oncology research\r\norganization with goals to expand clinical\r\nresearch accelerate drug development and\r\nincrease availability and access to clinical trials

strokes and improve overall stroke care\r\nThis initiative will launch in 15 select\r\nHCA Healthcare markets to empower consumers\r\nto know and better manage stroke risk deepen\r\ncollaboration between healthcare professionals\r\nand improve the overall health of communities\r\nThrough this collaboration we hope to have a\r\nsignificant impact in improving heart and brain\r\nhealth outcomes in order to beat stroke\r\nAdditionally we continue to show up for our\r\ncolleagues and the communities we serve in their\r\ntime of need\r\nIn the aftermath of Hurricane Ian\r\nHCA Healthcare showed up and supported our\r\nFlorida communities Our human resources and\r\nsupply chain teams deployed onsite minimarts\r\nfuel stations showers and laundry services in\r\nFlorida to assist facilities colleagues and nearby\r\nhealth systems in need In addition the\r\nHCA Healthcare Hope Fund received 776\r\napplications from colleagues with more than\r\n12 million being provided to

increased\r\nour investment in recruitment to help hire\r\napproximately 105000 colleagues\r\nTo further bolster our nursing development\r\nprograms HCA Healthcare opened seven more\r\nGalen College of Nursing schools We expect\r\nto open more schools in 2023 HCA Healthcare\r\nhas more than 93000 registered nurses holding\r\npositions from bedside caregivers to leadership\r\nroles in various healthcare settings and at every\r\nlevel throughout the organization Bringing Galen\r\ninto the HCA Healthcare family was designed\r\nto combine two leading nursing organizations\r\nto increase access to nursing education\r\nand to provide nursing career development\r\nopportunities for HCA Healthcare colleagues\r\nIn 2022 HCA Healthcare invested more than\r\n135 million in our clinical education programs\r\nincluding centers for clinical advancement These\r\ninvestments enhance the learning environment\r\nfor our people so we can advance nursing care for\r\nour patients Workforce development remains a\r\ntop priority We anticipate more investments in\r\nthese areas in the future\r\nAs part of our workforce development initiatives\r\nand to help with the country\u2019s issue of physician\r\nshortages HCA Healthcare has become a\r\nsignificant provider of medical education We\r\nhave 320 Accreditation Council for Graduate\r\nMedical Education ACGME programs more\r\nthan 5300 residents and fellows and 66 teaching\r\nhospitals across 16 states\r\nIn addition to growing the pipeline of physicians\r\nand nurses its important that we continue\r\nto upgrade our facilities to meet the growing\r\ndemand for healthcare In 2022 HCA Healthcare\r\ninvested 44 billion in our existing facilities\r\nThat\u2019s the most HCA Healthcare has ever\r\ninvested in our capital spending in a single year\r\nThese investments provide us with expanded\r\ncapacity advanced clinical technology and better\r\nfacilities for our patients\r\nAs part of our capital spending we continued\r\nto expand our outpatient network in key markets\r\nFor example in 2022 HCA Healthcare purchased\r\nMD Now Urgent Care a network of 59 urgent\r\ncare centers in Florida which was one of\r\nthe largest urgent care acquisitions in the\r\nhealthcare industry\r\nAdding MD Now Urgent Care in Florida enhances\r\nour already strong capabilities in a rapidly\r\ngrowing state by providing convenient outpatient\r\ncare options for our patients It also connects\r\nMD Now patients to a comprehensive statewide\r\nnetwork of care including acute care and\r\nspecialty services should they be needed\r\n2\r\n\r\nWe also announced plans to build new fullservice\r\nhospitals in Texas and Florida to help meet both\r\nstates\u2019 growing needs for healthcare services\r\nThese facilities and hospitals would provide more\r\nresources for the communities we serve and help\r\nus deliver the quality care and easier access our\r\npatients deserve\r\nAnd while we continued to educate our clinicians\r\nupdate our facilities and grow our networks\r\nHCA Healthcare continued to remain a leader in\r\noperational and clinical excellence\r\nWe are proud to say that in 2022

Companies\r\nranking an annual list that helps professionals\r\nidentify the top workplaces to grow their careers\r\nAdditionally we were named by Military Times as\r\none of the countrys best employers based on the\r\ncompanys efforts to recruit retain and support\r\ncurrent and former service members military\r\nspouses and military caregivers\r\nAs an organization we have programs and\r\ninitiatives that underscore our strong sense of\r\npurpose to do what is right for our patients\r\ncolleagues and the communities we serve and\r\nthese awards reflect that culture As a result\r\nand thanks to our clinical staffs hard work and\r\ndedication this past year in the fall 2022\r\nmore than 80 of our hospitals rated by The\r\nLeapfrog Group received an A or B Leapfrog\r\nSafety Score\r\nOn the innovation front HCA Healthcare\u2019s\r\nCare Transformation and Innovation CTI\r\ndepartment is working to deliver the healthcare\r\nof the future and support our care teams For\r\nexample this past year we launched a pilot in\r\nthe Labor and Delivery LD space \u2013 Staff\r\nScheduler The Staff Scheduler system predicts\r\nstaffing needs based on a machinelearning\r\nalgorithm measures the difficulty of procedures\r\nand improves staffing according to proficiencies\r\nand preferences Since the pilot launched we\r\nhave saved time improved staffing to meet our\r\npatients needs and increased nurse satisfaction\r\nCTI\u2019s work to identify build and roll out new\r\ntechnology solutions and innovative processes\r\nshould create better outcomes and experiences\r\nfor our care teams and patients We look forward\r\nto sharing more of their work\r\nTo further enhance our technology we decided\r\nto update our clinical systems This updated\r\nclinical system is designed to provide\r\nHCA Healthcare clinicians with an intuitive\r\nmobile user interface personalized to our\r\nworkflows In addition we expect it will allow us\r\nto standardize our data sets more effectively and\r\nutilize cloudbased analytics to support better\r\nclinical decisions improve efficiencies and create\r\na safer environment for our patients\r\nAnd as we continue to innovate and integrate\r\ntechnology into patient care we are partnering\r\nwith organizations that share our common goal\r\nFor example we recently partnered with\r\nMcKesson Corporation to form an oncology\r\nresearch joint venture combining McKessons\r\nUS Oncology Research USOR and\r\nHCA Healthcares Sarah Cannon Research\r\nInstitute SCRI Together USOR and SCRI\r\ncreate a fully integrated oncology research\r\norganization with goals to expand clinical\r\nresearch accelerate drug development and\r\nincrease availability and access to clinical trials for\r\ncommunity oncology providers and patients In\r\naddition this joint venture with McKesson which\r\nunifies our oncology research experts is intended\r\nto promote the development of individualized\r\ntherapies and provide more opportunities for\r\ncancer patients to receive new treatments\r\n3\r\n\r\nHCA Healthcare is collaborating with Johnson \r\nJohnson to address key issues in the healthcare\r\nindustry including improving health outcomes\r\nthrough earlystage lung cancer detection for\r\nthe Black community providing more resources\r\nfor our nurses on health equity issues and\r\ncollaborating on cardiovascular health initiatives\r\nHCA Healthcare and Johnson  Johnson have\r\nhad a long and productive relationship and both\r\ncompanies have worked hard to address many\r\nof our country\u2019s healthcare challenges We are\r\nexcited to collaborate to advance health equity\r\nenhance patient care and provide even greater\r\nsupport to our nurses\r\nAnd in conjunction with the HCA Healthcare\r\nFoundation and the American Heart Association\r\nwe have started a new initiative Getting to\r\nthe Heart of Stroke to help prevent initial and\r\nrecurrent strokes and improve overall stroke care\r\nThis initiative will launch in 15 select\r\nHCA Healthcare markets to empower consumers\r\nto know and better manage stroke risk deepen\r\ncollaboration between healthcare professionals\r\nand improve the overall health of communities\r\nThrough this collaboration we hope to have a\r\nsignificant impact in improving heart and brain\r\nhealth outcomes in order to beat stroke\r\nAdditionally we continue to show up for our\r\ncolleagues and the communities we serve in their\r\ntime of need\r\nIn the aftermath of Hurricane Ian\r\nHCA Healthcare showed up and supported our\r\nFlorida communities Our human resources and\r\nsupply chain teams deployed onsite minimarts\r\nfuel stations showers and laundry services in\r\nFlorida to assist facilities colleagues and nearby\r\nhealth systems in need In addition the\r\nHCA Healthcare Hope Fund received 776\r\napplications from colleagues with more than\r\n12 million being provided to colleagues\r\nimpacted by the hurricane We are incredibly\r\nproud of how our Florida colleagues responded\r\nbefore during and in the wake of Hurricane Ian\r\nFurthermore HCA Healthcare and the\r\nHCA Healthcare Foundation showed up\r\nand supported several organizations in our\r\ncommunities throughout the year For example\r\nthe Foundation committed approximately 138\r\nmillion over three years to the Girl Scouts of the\r\nUSA to provide mental wellness workshops to\r\ngirls in grades 412 nationwide over 350000\r\nto Kentucky flood relief efforts 600000\r\nto Volunteers of America over two years to\r\npromote mental wellbeing and resiliency for first\r\nresponders and frontline caregivers 250000\r\nto the American Red Cross to support disaster\r\nrelief and preparedness nationwide and more\r\nThrough the HCA Healthcare Foundation\u2019s\r\nHealthier Tomorrow Fund we are also\r\naligning with strategic partners who share our\r\ngoal of creating a more diverse pipeline of\r\nhealthcare leaders\r\nThe HCA Healthcare Foundation also committed\r\nto donating 135 million over the next three\r\nyears to Educate Texas an initiative of the\r\nCommunities Foundation of Texas This grant\r\naims to increase access to student programs\r\nthat enable healthcare careers including\r\nhigh schools in Texas that offer Pathways in\r\nTechnology Early College High School PTECH\r\nhealthcare career tracks\r\nWe also continued our commitment to support\r\nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities\r\nHBCUs and HispanicServing Institutions\r\nHSIs in communities near our hospitals As\r\npart of this commitment we are investing 15\r\nmillion to Florida International Universitys\r\nNicole Wertheim College of Nursing  Health\r\nSciences NWCNHS to address the national\r\nnursing shortage Additionally we announced\r\nan investment of 750000 to The University of\r\nTexas at El Paso to advance diversity in healthcare\r\n4\r\n\r\nleadership HCA Healthcare is

pursuing the accelerated dualdegree program with Galen College of Nursing\r\nHCA Healthcare has announced approximately 675 million in gifts since 2021 to multiple colleges and\r\nuniversities as part of our threeyear 10 million pledge to HBCUsHSIs These partnerships will help\r\nsupport students pursuing a career in healthcare and in turn create a more diverse talent pipeline of\r\nhealthcare leaders\r\nOur dedication to showing up for the communities we serve also includes understanding how the\r\nenvironment impacts overall health To help ensure our current and future environmental strategies like\r\nreducing our carbon emissions are carried out HCA Healthcare has robust governance in place to prepare\r\nand execute our sustainability plans\r\nWe look forward to continuing to show up for our colleagues and communities in 2023 and beyond\r\nAs we push forward on our journey to be the provider system of choice HCA Healthcare announced\r\norganizational changes which we believe can be a catalyst for unlocking even more value for our\r\nstakeholders As of January 1 2023 we have a new operating model that includes a chief operating\r\nofficer an additional senior vice presidentfinance and three operating groups with five domestic\r\ndivisions each The new organizational design reflects a structure that is intended to align better with our\r\nstrategy streamline areas that can improve longterm performance and provide greater focus and better\r\ncoordination in supporting our business As mentioned previously the COVID19 pandemic taught us that\r\nwe need to be wellpositioned to make timely decisions and act quickly We believe that\u2019s exactly what this\r\nstructural change will do\r\nAll in all we are coming out of this pandemic with momentum We believe HCA Healthcare is wellpositioned culturally competitively and financially We are grateful for the hard work and dedication our\r\ncolleagues showed this past year in carrying out HCA Healthcare\u2019s mission and we want to thank them in\r\nadvance for what they\u2019re going to accomplish in the year aheadapproximately 2300 ambulatory sites of care cared for more than 37 million patients Our people nearly 294000 colleagues and 45000 physicians on our medical staff fulfilled our core mission by continuing to show up and deliver highquality healthcare services to our communities The impact of COVID19 continued to significantly influence the healthcare industry however HCA Healthcare performed well by balancing local needs while also developing more enterprise capabilities to support our local networks As leaders our actions were informed by lessons learned during the pandemic the importance of setting clear priorities the power of teamwork and partnerships the significance of timely decisionmaking and execution and communicating timely and transparently to our stakeholders The aftermath of the pandemic created a number of industrywide challenges There has been a clear disruption in the labor market inflationary pressures have driven up costs and capacity constraints have affected the ability to meet patient demand To address these matters our teams continued to incorporate financial resiliency measures while focusing on four key areas recruitment retention new care models and capacity management These initiatives will carry us into 2023 Financially we ended the year in

healthcare settings and at every\r\nlevel throughout the organization Bringing Galen\r\ninto the HCA Healthcare family was designed\r\nto combine two leading nursing organizations\r\nto increase access to nursing education\r\nand to provide nursing career development\r\nopportunities for HCA Healthcare colleagues\r\nIn 2022 HCA Healthcare invested more than\r\n135 million in our clinical education programs\r\nincluding centers for clinical advancement These\r\ninvestments enhance the learning environment\r\nfor our people so we can advance nursing care for\r\nour patients Workforce development remains a\r\ntop priority We anticipate more investments in\r\nthese areas in the future\r\nAs part of our workforce development initiatives\r\nand to help with the country\u2019s issue of physician\r\nshortages HCA Healthcare has become a\r\nsignificant provider of medical education We\r\nhave 320 Accreditation Council for Graduate\r\nMedical Education ACGME programs more\r\nthan 5300 residents and fellows and 66 teaching\r\nhospitals across 16 states\r\nIn addition to growing the pipeline of physicians\r\nand nurses its important that we continue\r\nto upgrade our facilities to meet the growing\r\ndemand for healthcare In 2022 HCA Healthcare\r\ninvested 44 billion in our existing facilities\r\nThat\u2019s the most HCA Healthcare has ever\r\ninvested in our capital spending in a single year\r\nThese investments provide us with expanded\r\ncapacity advanced clinical technology and better\r\nfacilities for our patients\r\nAs part of our capital spending we continued\r\nto expand our outpatient network in key markets\r\nFor example in 2022 HCA Healthcare purchased\r\nMD Now Urgent Care a network of 59 urgent\r\ncare centers in Florida which was one of\r\nthe largest urgent care acquisitions in the\r\nhealthcare industry\r\nAdding MD Now Urgent Care in Florida enhances\r\nour already strong capabilities in a rapidly\r\ngrowing state by providing convenient outpatient\r\ncare options for our patients It also connects\r\nMD Now patients to a comprehensive statewide\r\nnetwork of care including acute care and\r\nspecialty services should they be needed\r\n2\r\n\r\nWe also announced plans to build new fullservice\r\nhospitals in Texas and Florida to help meet both\r\nstates\u2019 growing needs for healthcare services\r\nThese facilities and hospitals would provide more\r\nresources for the communities we serve and help\r\nus deliver the quality care and easier access our\r\npatients deserve\r\nAnd while we continued to educate our clinicians\r\nupdate our facilities and grow our networks\r\nHCA Healthcare continued to remain a leader in\r\noperational and clinical excellence\r\nWe are proud to say that in 2022 Ethisphere\r\nrecognized HCA Healthcare as one of the Worlds\r\nMost Ethical Companies for the 12th time We\r\nwere also recognized for the second consecutive\r\nyear on the 2022 LinkedIn Top Companies\r\nranking an annual list that helps professionals\r\nidentify the top workplaces to grow their careers\r\nAdditionally we were named by Military Times as\r\none of the countrys best employers based on the\r\ncompanys efforts to recruit retain and support\r\ncurrent and former service members military\r\nspouses and military caregivers\r\nAs an organization we have programs and\r\ninitiatives that underscore our strong sense of\r\npurpose to do what is right for our patients\r\ncolleagues and the communities we serve and\r\nthese awards reflect that culture As a result\r\nand thanks to our clinical staffs hard work and\r\ndedication this past year in the fall 2022\r\nmore than 80 of our hospitals rated by The\r\nLeapfrog Group received an A or B Leapfrog\r\nSafety Score\r\nOn the innovation front HCA Healthcare\u2019s\r\nCare Transformation and Innovation CTI\r\ndepartment is working to deliver the healthcare\r\nof the future and support our care teams For\r\nexample this past year we launched a pilot in\r\nthe Labor and Delivery LD space \u2013 Staff\r\nScheduler The Staff Scheduler system predicts\r\nstaffing needs based on a machinelearning\r\nalgorithm measures the difficulty of procedures\r\nand improves staffing according to proficiencies\r\nand preferences Since the pilot launched we\r\nhave saved time improved staffing to meet our\r\npatients needs and increased nurse satisfaction\r\nCTI\u2019s work to identify build and roll out new\r\ntechnology solutions and innovative processes\r\nshould create better outcomes and experiences\r\nfor our care teams and patients We look forward\r\nto sharing more of their work\r\nTo further enhance our technology we decided\r\nto update our clinical systems This updated\r\nclinical system is designed to provide\r\nHCA Healthcare clinicians with an intuitive\r\nmobile user interface personalized to our\r\nworkflows In addition we expect it will allow us\r\nto standardize our data sets more effectively and\r\nutilize cloudbased analytics to support better\r\nclinical decisions improve efficiencies and create\r\na safer environment for our patients\r\nAnd as we continue to innovate and integrate\r\ntechnology into patient care we are partnering\r\nwith organizations that share our common goal\r\nFor example we recently partnered with\r\nMcKesson Corporation to form an oncology\r\nresearch joint venture combining McKessons\r\nUS Oncology Research USOR and\r\nHCA Healthcares Sarah Cannon Research\r\nInstitute SCRI Together USOR and SCRI\r\ncreate a fully integrated oncology research\r\norganization with goals to expand clinical\r\nresearch accelerate drug development and\r\nincrease availability and access to clinical trials for\r\ncommunity oncology providers and patients In\r\naddition this joint venture with McKesson which\r\nunifies our oncology research experts is intended\r\nto promote the development of individualized\r\ntherapies and provide more opportunities for\r\ncancer patients to receive new treatments\r\n3\r\n\r\nHCA Healthcare is collaborating with Johnson \r\nJohnson to address key issues in the healthcare\r\nindustry including improving health outcomes\r\nthrough earlystage lung cancer detection for\r\nthe Black community providing more resources\r\nfor our nurses on health equity issues and\r\ncollaborating on cardiovascular health initiatives\r\nHCA Healthcare and Johnson  Johnson have\r\nhad a long and productive relationship and both\r\ncompanies have worked hard to address many\r\nof our country\u2019s healthcare challenges We are\r\nexcited to collaborate to advance health equity\r\nenhance patient care and provide even greater\r\nsupport to our nurses\r\nAnd in conjunction with the HCA Healthcare\r\nFoundation and the American Heart Association\r\nwe have started a new initiative Getting to\r\nthe Heart of Stroke to help prevent initial and\r\nrecurrent strokes and improve overall stroke care\r\nThis initiative will launch in 15 select\r\nHCA Healthcare markets to empower consumers\r\nto know and better manage stroke risk deepen\r\ncollaboration between healthcare professionals\r\nand improve the overall health of communities\r\nThrough this collaboration we hope to have a\r\nsignificant impact in improving heart and brain\r\nhealth outcomes in order to beat stroke\r\nAdditionally we continue to show up for our\r\ncolleagues and the communities we serve in their\r\ntime of need\r\nIn the aftermath of Hurricane Ian\r\nHCA Healthcare showed up and supported our\r\nFlorida communities Our human resources and\r\nsupply chain teams deployed onsite minimarts\r\nfuel stations showers and laundry services in\r\nFlorida to assist facilities colleagues and nearby\r\nhealth systems in need In addition the\r\nHCA Healthcare Hope Fund received 776\r\napplications from colleagues with more than\r\n12 million being provided to colleagues\r\nimpacted by the hurricane We are incredibly\r\nproud of how our Florida colleagues responded\r\nbefore during and in the wake of Hurricane Ian\r\nFurthermore HCA Healthcare and the\r\nHCA Healthcare Foundation showed up\r\nand supported several organizations in our\r\ncommunities throughout the year For example\r\nthe Foundation committed approximately 138\r\nmillion over three years to the Girl Scouts of the\r\nUSA to provide mental wellness workshops to\r\ngirls in grades 412 nationwide over 350000\r\nto Kentucky flood relief efforts 600000\r\nto Volunteers of America over two years to\r\npromote mental wellbeing and resiliency for first\r\nresponders and frontline caregivers 250000\r\nto the American Red Cross to support disaster\r\nrelief and preparedness nationwide and more\r\nThrough the HCA Healthcare Foundation\u2019s\r\nHealthier Tomorrow Fund we are also\r\naligning with strategic partners who share our\r\ngoal of creating a more diverse pipeline of\r\nhealthcare leaders\r\nThe HCA Healthcare Foundation also committed\r\nto donating 135 million over the next three\r\nyears to Educate Texas an initiative of the\r\nCommunities Foundation of Texas This grant\r\naims to increase access to student programs\r\nthat enable healthcare careers including\r\nhigh schools in Texas that offer Pathways in\r\nTechnology Early College High School PTECH\r\nhealthcare career tracks\r\nWe also continued our commitment to support\r\nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities\r\nHBCUs and HispanicServing Institutions\r\nHSIs in communities near our hospitals As\r\npart of this commitment we are investing 15\r\nmillion to Florida International Universitys\r\nNicole Wertheim College of Nursing  Health\r\nSciences NWCNHS to address the national\r\nnursing shortage Additionally we announced\r\nan investment of 750000 to The University of\r\nTexas at El Paso to advance diversity in healthcare\r\n4\r\n\r\nleadership HCA Healthcare is also investing 155 million to Tennessee State University to fund scholarships\r\nfor students pursuing healthcare and computer science careers and 15 million to Fisk University to\r\nsupport students pursuing the accelerated dualdegree program with Galen College of Nursing\r\nHCA Healthcare has announced approximately 675 million in gifts since 2021 to multiple colleges and\r\nuniversities as part of our threeyear 10 million pledge to HBCUsHSIs These partnerships will help\r\nsupport students pursuing a career in healthcare and in turn create a more diverse talent pipeline of\r\nhealthcare leaders\r\nOur dedication to showing up for the communities we serve also includes understanding how the\r\nenvironment impacts overall health To help ensure our current and future environmental strategies like\r\nreducing our carbon emissions are carried out HCA Healthcare has robust governance in place to prepare\r\nand execute our sustainability plans\r\nWe look forward to continuing to show up for our colleagues and communities in 2023 and beyond\r\nAs we push forward on our journey to be the provider system of choice HCA Healthcare announced\r\norganizational changes which we believe can be a catalyst for unlocking even more value for our\r\nstakeholders As of January 1 2023 we have a new operating model that includes a chief operating\r\nofficer an additional senior vice presidentfinance and three operating groups with five domestic\r\ndivisions each The new organizational design reflects a structure that is intended to align better with our\r\nstrategy streamline areas that can improve longterm performance and provide greater focus and better\r\ncoordination in supporting our business As mentioned previously the COVID19 pandemic taught us that\r\nwe need to be wellpositioned to make timely decisions and act quickly We believe that\u2019s exactly what this\r\nstructural change will do\r\nAll in all we are coming out of this pandemic with momentum We believe HCA Healthcare is wellpositioned culturally competitively and financially We are grateful for the hard work and dedication our\r\ncolleagues showed this past year in carrying out HCA Healthcare\u2019s mission and we want to thank them in\r\nadvance for what they\u2019re going to accomplish in the year aheadapproximately 2300 ambulatory sites of care cared for more than 37 million patients Our people nearly 294000 colleagues and 45000 physicians on our medical staff fulfilled our core mission by continuing to show up and deliver highquality healthcare services to our communities The impact of COVID19 continued to significantly influence the healthcare industry however HCA Healthcare performed well by balancing local needs while also developing more enterprise capabilities to support our local networks As leaders our actions were informed by lessons learned during the pandemic the importance of setting clear priorities the power of teamwork and partnerships the significance of timely decisionmaking and execution and communicating timely and transparently to our stakeholders The aftermath of the pandemic created a number of industrywide challenges There has been a clear disruption in the labor market inflationary pressures have driven up costs and capacity constraints have affected the ability to meet patient demand To address these matters our teams continued to incorporate financial resiliency measures while focusing on four key areas recruitment retention new care models and capacity management These initiatives will carry us into 2023 Financially we ended the year in a solid position Our revenues for the year totaled 602 billion a 25 increase from 2021 We generated 85 billion in cash flows from operations providing us with the capacity to execute a balanced approach to capital allocation \u2022 As you see later in this letter we invested substantial amounts of capital into our facilities \u2022 We repurchased 7 billion or over 30 million shares of common stock \u2022 We increased our quarterly dividend by 17 over 2021 Additionally we generated over 12 billion of pretax proceeds from divestitures And as a taxpaying healthcare provider we incurred approximately 56 billion of federal state and local taxes including 23 billion of income property and sales and use

and a constructive stock market That changed in February when Russia invaded Ukraine The outbreak of war on Europe\u2019s eastern borders was within months followed by a surge in inflation rapidly increasing interest rates lower stock and bond market valuations and growing talk of a Fedinduced recession Adding to the uncertainty businesses and employees everywhere began learning how to blend inperson and remote working as the pandemic gradually morphed into an endemic phase The pace and breadth of changes in the global economic and fiscal environment once again underscored the financial fragility of billions of people around the globe And it reinforced for all of us at Prudential the importance of fulfilling our purpose \u2014 to make lives better by solving the financial challenges of our changing world Against that backdrop we began 2022 by articulating a new vision for Prudential to help employees and other stakeholders understand the company we aspire to become That vision is for Prudential to be a global leader in expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security In support of this aspiration we made substantive progress in executing our strategy and implementing the ongoing transformation of Prudential into a higher growth less market sensitive and more nimble company Examples of our progress include \u2022 We acquired a 33 interest in AlexForbes a leading provider of financial advice retirement and wealth and asset management in South Africa as part of our programmatic MA strategy to invest in higher growth businesses \u2022 We reduced the market volatility of our businesses by 20 through the sale of our fullservice retirement business and a portion of our legacy traditional variable annuity block \u2022 We achieved our target of 750 million in cost savings one year ahead of schedule In fact by the end of 2022 we realized more than 800 million in annual runrate cost savings Just as importantly we intensified our work to identify and seize new opportunities stemming from Prudential\u2019s selfreinforcing business system \u2014 a unique combination of differentiated yet interrelated and complementary businesses that includes PGIM our global asset manager and our marketleading insurance and retirement businesses By design Prudential\u2019s businesses are mutually enhancing Our insurance and retirement businesses provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated flows and access to insurance liabilities that complement its track record of thirdparty growth Similarly PGIM\u2019s diverse asset mix and excellent longterm investment record enable our retail and institutional businesses to offer more competitive products \u201cWe made substantive progress in executing our strategy and implementing the ongoing transformation of Prudential into a higher growth less market sensitive and more nimble company\u201d 2 Prudential Financial Inc 2022 Annual Report that address a wider range of customer needs By reinforcing and enhancing each other our businesses also create opportunities to serve customers in new ways as well as additional sources of growth As an example in 2022 we completed the secondlargest pension risk transfer transaction in US market history with IBM providing PGIM with 8 billion in additional assets under management Changing our business mix Despite the challenging market conditions and economic environment of 2022 our businesses remained resilient and wellpositioned and we continued to invest in opportunities with potential for longterm growth As part of that work we are continuing to shift the mix of our US Businesses toward higher growth and less marketsensitive products while transforming our capabilities and cost structure and expanding our addressable market We are changing our business mix through divestitures and more importantly through innovation By offering new and creative product solutions we are meeting the evolving needs of a broader range of customers For example our innovative suite of FlexGuard products is growing in scope and has garnered more than 12 billion in sales since its launch in 2020 Building on that success in 2022 we introduced FlexGuard Life which offers a flexible combination of protection growth and access to meet consumers\u2019 changing life insurance needs We also continue to invest in our International Businesses In Japan our marketleading life insurance companies deliver highquality service through a differentiated multichannel distribution model Intent on fueling further growth in Japan we are expanding our geographic presence and our product portfolio to meet a broader range of customer needs We continue developing our thirdparty distribution network in Latin America particularly in Brazil where thirdparty distribution now accounts for about 50 of sales and complements our strong Life Planner channel In addition we are expanding our carefully selected portfolio of businesses in emerging markets We are investing in regions where customer needs are growing where we see compelling opportunities to build marketleading operations and where we can add value Achieving cost savings and improved efficiency The impact of our efforts to transform Prudential into a higher growth and more nimble company is also evident in our achievement of more than 800 million in annual cost savings by the end of 2022 To realize this level of reductions we assessed every aspect of our company seeking to streamline and automate how we operate while investing in advanced technology to improve the experiences of our customers and our employees This work has yielded numerous benefits \u2022 By embracing a hybrid work model we reduced our office space footprint in the US by 50 resulting in annual savings of about 50 million \u2022 Using artificial intelligence we accelerated underwriting for individual life insurance from 22 days to 22 seconds \u2022 Thanks to a new digital claims processing capability we can deliver funds to most customers in six hours versus the six days it previously took to complete transactions Our progress reflects the adoption across the company of a mindset of continuous improvement This approach is helping us identify and execute costsavings opportunities on an ongoing basis while sharpening our competitive edge and delivering better customer experiences and nextgeneration solutions Investing for growth and delivering shareholder value For nearly 150 years Prudential\u2019s Rock Solid\u00ae balance sheet and disciplined approach to capital management and deployment have helped our company navigate financial and macroeconomic challenges and deliver on our promises to our customers and other stakeholders 2022 was no exception Consistent with our AA financial strength rating we have maintained a strong capital position a highquality and welldiversified investment portfolio and highly liquid assets which totaled 45 billion at the end of the year As always we are balancing investing for longterm growth with delivering returns to our shareholders For example in 2022 we invested more than 3 billion to drive growth across our businesses while returning more than 3 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases In all since 2021 we have returned more than 75 billion to shareholders Prudential Financial Inc 2022 Annual Report 3 We are continuing to enhance returns to investors For 2023 our Board of Directors authorized 1 billion in share repurchases as well as a 4 dividend increase beginning in the first quarter representing the 15th consecutive annual increase in our dividend We remain committed to our longstanding capital management philosophy of increasing shareholder distributions as our company grows Committed to our talent culture and communities To achieve our vision and create growth over the long term we must continually strengthen and expand our selfreinforcing business system As we pursue that objective we will continue to advance sustainability on multiple fronts For us sustainability means attracting developing and retaining talented employees who share Prudential\u2019s commitment to equity and inclusion It means maintaining a strong culture of governance and always doing business the right way It demands we constantly innovate designing nextgeneration services and solutions for our customers and clients It requires us to deliver enhanced value to our shareholders and other stakeholders And it means caring for our environment and the communities in which we live and work Our employees are the cornerstone of our success That is why attracting developing and retaining outstanding talent is a top priority We also remain intent on providing an inclusive workplace that offers equitable compensation career mobility and opportunities for employees to continuously learn and grow To that end we are committed to transparency about our compensation practices and to becoming even more inclusive For example in our next annual sustainability report we again will share data detailing the composition of our US workforce by race ethnicity and gender and related compensation metrics We initiated this additional reporting so all our stakeholders \u2014 including our employees investors and customers \u2014 can measure our progress and hold us accountable This objective reflects our purpose and unique company culture which is based on integrity respect for one another and celebrating the diverse perspectives and experiences of our employees Our commitment to living our purpose also is reflected in our ongoing community involvement and philanthropy starting in our hometown of Newark NJ where Prudential was founded in 1875 Over the past decade we have invested more than 12 billion in Newark to help build thriving neighborhoods across the city and bring financial opportunity to more of its residents Following the pandemic we centralized our New Jersey operations in the city as part of our broader commitment as one of its anchor institutions We also continue to fund improvements to Newark\u2019s public spaces and support its cultural educational and social institutions We are also pressing forward to fulfill the commitments we made in 2020 to advance racial equity on behalf of our people through our businesses and in society These commitments reflect our longstanding efforts to drive social progress close the racial wealth gap and help build more vibrant and inclusive communities around the world Confident in our purpose vision and strategy In 2022 despite an unpredictable and rapidly evolving environment we advanced our transformation seized growth opportunities and stayed focused on serving our customers Working together Prudential\u2019s nearly 40000 employees will continue to build on the progress we made challenging ourselves to help more customers achieve financial resiliency and deliver increased value to our stakeholders Prudential\u2019s history \u2014 stretching back almost 150 years \u2014 is a proud reminder of what we can achieve Time and again we have shown we have the foresight and financial

and a constructive stock market That changed in February when Russia invaded Ukraine The outbreak of war on Europe\u2019s eastern borders was within months followed by a surge in inflation rapidly increasing interest rates lower stock and bond market valuations and growing talk of a Fedinduced recession Adding to the uncertainty businesses and employees everywhere began learning how to blend inperson and remote working as the pandemic gradually morphed into an endemic phase The pace and breadth of changes in the global economic and fiscal environment once again underscored the financial fragility of billions of people around the globe And it reinforced for all of us at Prudential the importance of fulfilling our purpose \u2014 to make lives better by solving the financial challenges of our changing world Against that backdrop we began 2022 by articulating a new vision for Prudential to help employees and other stakeholders understand the company we aspire to become That vision is for Prudential to be a global leader in expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security In support of this aspiration we made substantive progress in executing our strategy and implementing the ongoing transformation of Prudential into a higher growth less market sensitive and more nimble company Examples of our progress include \u2022 We acquired a 33 interest in AlexForbes a leading provider of financial advice retirement and wealth and asset management in South Africa as part of our programmatic MA strategy to invest in higher growth businesses \u2022 We reduced the market volatility of our businesses by 20 through the sale of our fullservice retirement business and a portion of our legacy traditional variable annuity block \u2022 We achieved our target of 750 million in cost savings one year ahead of schedule In fact by the end of 2022 we realized more than 800 million in annual runrate cost savings Just as importantly we intensified our work to identify and seize new opportunities stemming from Prudential\u2019s selfreinforcing business system \u2014 a unique combination of differentiated yet interrelated and complementary businesses that includes PGIM our global asset manager and our marketleading insurance and retirement businesses By design Prudential\u2019s businesses are mutually enhancing Our insurance and retirement businesses provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated flows and access to insurance liabilities that complement its track record of thirdparty growth Similarly PGIM\u2019s diverse asset mix and excellent longterm investment record enable our retail and institutional businesses to offer more competitive products \u201cWe made substantive progress in executing our strategy and implementing the ongoing transformation of Prudential into a higher growth less market sensitive and more nimble company\u201d 2 Prudential Financial Inc 2022 Annual Report that address a wider range of customer needs By reinforcing and enhancing each other our businesses also create opportunities to serve customers in new ways as well as additional sources of growth As an example in 2022 we completed the secondlargest pension risk transfer transaction in US market history with IBM providing PGIM with 8 billion in additional assets under management Changing our business mix Despite the challenging market conditions and economic environment of 2022 our businesses remained resilient and wellpositioned and we continued to invest in opportunities with potential for longterm growth As part of that work we are continuing to shift the mix of our US Businesses toward higher growth and less marketsensitive products while transforming our capabilities and cost structure and expanding our addressable market We are changing our business mix through divestitures and more importantly through innovation By offering new and creative product solutions we are meeting the evolving needs of a broader range of customers For example our innovative suite of FlexGuard products is growing in scope and has garnered more than 12 billion in sales since its launch in 2020 Building on that success in 2022 we introduced FlexGuard Life which offers a flexible combination of protection growth and access to meet consumers\u2019 changing life insurance needs We also continue to invest in our International Businesses In Japan our marketleading life insurance companies deliver highquality service through a differentiated multichannel distribution model Intent on fueling further growth in Japan we are expanding our geographic presence and our product portfolio to meet a broader range of customer needs We continue developing our thirdparty distribution network in Latin America particularly in Brazil where thirdparty distribution now accounts for about 50 of sales and complements our strong Life Planner channel In addition we are expanding our carefully selected portfolio of businesses in emerging markets We are investing in regions where customer needs are growing where we see compelling opportunities to build marketleading operations and where we can add value Achieving cost savings and improved efficiency The impact of our efforts to transform Prudential into a higher growth and more nimble company is also evident in our achievement of more than 800 million in annual cost savings by the end of 2022 To realize this level of reductions we assessed every aspect of our company seeking to streamline and automate how we operate while investing in advanced technology to improve the experiences of our customers and our employees This work has yielded numerous benefits \u2022 By embracing a hybrid work model we reduced our office space footprint in the US by 50 resulting in annual savings of about 50 million \u2022 Using artificial intelligence we accelerated underwriting for individual life insurance from 22 days to 22 seconds \u2022 Thanks to a new digital claims processing capability we can deliver funds to most customers in six hours versus the six days it previously took to complete transactions Our progress reflects the adoption across the company of a mindset of continuous improvement This approach is helping us identify and execute costsavings opportunities on an ongoing basis while sharpening our competitive edge and delivering better customer experiences and nextgeneration solutions Investing for growth and delivering shareholder value For nearly 150 years Prudential\u2019s Rock Solid\u00ae balance sheet and disciplined approach to capital management and deployment have helped our company navigate financial and macroeconomic challenges and deliver on our promises to our customers and other stakeholders 2022 was no exception Consistent with our AA financial strength rating we have maintained a strong capital position a highquality and welldiversified investment portfolio and highly liquid assets which totaled 45 billion at the end of the year As always we are balancing investing for longterm growth with delivering returns to our shareholders For example in 2022 we invested more than 3 billion to drive growth across our businesses while returning more than 3 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases In all since 2021 we have returned more than 75 billion to shareholders Prudential Financial Inc 2022 Annual Report 3 We are continuing to enhance returns to investors For 2023 our Board of Directors authorized 1 billion in share repurchases as well as a 4 dividend increase beginning in the first quarter representing the 15th consecutive annual increase in our dividend We remain committed to our longstanding capital management philosophy of increasing shareholder distributions as our company grows Committed to our talent culture and communities To achieve our vision and create growth over the long term we must continually strengthen and expand our selfreinforcing business system As we pursue that objective we will continue to advance sustainability on multiple fronts For us sustainability means attracting developing and retaining talented employees who share Prudential\u2019s commitment to equity and inclusion It means maintaining a strong culture of governance and always doing business the right way It demands we constantly innovate designing nextgeneration services and solutions for our customers and clients It requires us to deliver enhanced value to our shareholders and other stakeholders And it means caring for our environment and the communities in which we live and work Our employees are the cornerstone of our success That is why attracting developing and retaining outstanding talent is a top priority We also remain intent on providing an inclusive workplace that offers equitable compensation career mobility and opportunities for employees to continuously learn and grow To that end we are committed to transparency about our compensation practices and to becoming even more inclusive For example in our next annual sustainability report we again will share data detailing the composition of our US workforce by race ethnicity and gender and related compensation metrics We initiated this additional reporting so all our stakeholders \u2014 including our employees investors and customers \u2014 can measure our progress and hold us accountable This objective reflects our purpose and unique company culture which is based on integrity respect for one another and celebrating the diverse perspectives and experiences of our employees Our commitment to living our purpose also is reflected in our ongoing community involvement and philanthropy starting in our hometown of Newark NJ where Prudential was founded in 1875 Over the past decade we have invested more than 12 billion in Newark to help build thriving neighborhoods across the city and bring financial opportunity to more of its residents Following the pandemic we centralized our New Jersey operations in the city as part of our broader commitment as one of its anchor institutions We also continue to fund improvements to Newark\u2019s public spaces and support its cultural educational and social institutions We are also pressing forward to fulfill the commitments we made in 2020 to advance racial equity on behalf of our people through our businesses and in society These commitments reflect our longstanding efforts to drive social progress close the racial wealth gap and help build more vibrant and inclusive communities around the world Confident in our purpose vision and strategy In 2022 despite an unpredictable and rapidly evolving environment we advanced our transformation seized growth opportunities and stayed focused on serving our customers Working together Prudential\u2019s nearly 40000 employees will continue to build on the progress we made challenging ourselves to help more customers achieve financial resiliency and deliver increased value to our stakeholders Prudential\u2019s history \u2014 stretching back almost 150 years \u2014 is a proud reminder of what we can achieve Time and again we have shown we have the foresight and financial strength required to navigate whatever challenges come our way while continuing to invest for the future As we look to 2023 we remain grounded in our purpose confident in our vision and strategy and

and a constructive stock market That changed in February when Russia invaded Ukraine The outbreak of war on Europe\u2019s eastern borders was within months followed by a surge in inflation rapidly increasing interest rates lower stock and bond market valuations and growing talk of a Fedinduced recession Adding to the uncertainty businesses and employees everywhere began learning how to blend inperson and remote working as the pandemic gradually morphed into an endemic phase The pace and breadth of changes in the global economic and fiscal environment once again underscored the financial fragility of billions of people around the globe And it reinforced for all of us at Prudential the importance of fulfilling our purpose \u2014 to make lives better by solving the financial challenges of our changing world Against that backdrop we began 2022 by articulating a new vision for Prudential to help employees and other stakeholders understand the company we aspire to become That vision is for Prudential to be a global leader in expanding access to investing insurance and retirement security In support of this aspiration we made substantive progress in executing our strategy and implementing the ongoing transformation of Prudential into a higher growth less market sensitive and more nimble company Examples of our progress include \u2022 We acquired a 33 interest in AlexForbes a leading provider of financial advice retirement and wealth and asset management in South Africa as part of our programmatic MA strategy to invest in higher growth businesses \u2022 We reduced the market volatility of our businesses by 20 through the sale of our fullservice retirement business and a portion of our legacy traditional variable annuity block \u2022 We achieved our target of 750 million in cost savings one year ahead of schedule In fact by the end of 2022 we realized more than 800 million in annual runrate cost savings Just as importantly we intensified our work to identify and seize new opportunities stemming from Prudential\u2019s selfreinforcing business system \u2014 a unique combination of differentiated yet interrelated and complementary businesses that includes PGIM our global asset manager and our marketleading insurance and retirement businesses By design Prudential\u2019s businesses are mutually enhancing Our insurance and retirement businesses provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated flows and access to insurance liabilities that complement its track record of thirdparty growth Similarly PGIM\u2019s diverse asset mix and excellent longterm investment record enable our retail and institutional businesses to offer more competitive products \u201cWe made substantive progress in executing our strategy and implementing the ongoing transformation of Prudential into a higher growth less market sensitive and more nimble company\u201d 2 Prudential Financial Inc 2022 Annual Report that address a wider range of customer needs By reinforcing and enhancing each other our businesses also create opportunities to serve customers in new ways as well as additional sources of growth As an example in 2022 we completed the secondlargest pension risk transfer transaction in US market history with IBM providing PGIM with 8 billion in additional assets under management Changing our business mix Despite the challenging market conditions and economic environment of 2022 our businesses remained resilient and wellpositioned and we continued to invest in opportunities with potential for longterm growth As part of that work we are continuing to shift the mix of our US Businesses toward higher growth and less marketsensitive products while transforming our capabilities and cost structure and expanding our addressable market We are changing our business mix through divestitures and more importantly through innovation By offering new and creative product solutions we are meeting the evolving needs of a broader range of customers For example our innovative suite of FlexGuard products is growing in scope and has garnered more than 12 billion in sales since its launch in 2020 Building on that success in 2022 we introduced FlexGuard Life which offers a flexible combination of protection growth and access to meet consumers\u2019 changing life insurance needs We also continue to invest in our International Businesses In Japan our marketleading life insurance companies deliver highquality service through a differentiated multichannel distribution model Intent on fueling further growth in Japan we are expanding our geographic presence and our product portfolio to meet a broader range of customer needs We continue developing our thirdparty distribution network in Latin America particularly in Brazil where thirdparty distribution now accounts for about 50 of sales and complements our strong Life Planner channel In addition we are expanding our carefully selected portfolio of businesses in emerging markets We are investing in regions where customer needs are growing where we see compelling opportunities to build marketleading operations and where we can add value Achieving cost savings and improved efficiency The impact of our efforts to transform Prudential into a higher growth and more nimble company is also evident in our achievement of more than 800 million in annual cost savings by the end of 2022 To realize this level of reductions we assessed every aspect of our company seeking to streamline and automate how we operate while investing in advanced technology to improve the experiences of our customers and our employees This work has yielded numerous benefits \u2022 By embracing a hybrid work model we reduced our office space footprint in the US by 50 resulting in annual savings of about 50 million \u2022 Using artificial intelligence we accelerated underwriting for individual life insurance from 22 days to 22 seconds \u2022 Thanks to a new digital claims processing capability we can deliver funds to most customers in six hours versus the six days it previously took to complete transactions Our progress reflects the adoption across the company of a mindset of continuous improvement This approach is helping us identify and execute costsavings opportunities on an ongoing basis while sharpening our competitive edge and delivering better customer experiences and nextgeneration solutions Investing for growth and delivering shareholder value For nearly 150 years Prudential\u2019s Rock Solid\u00ae balance sheet and disciplined approach to capital management and deployment have helped our company navigate financial and macroeconomic challenges and deliver on our promises to our customers and other stakeholders 2022 was no exception Consistent with our AA financial strength rating we have maintained a strong capital position a highquality and welldiversified investment portfolio and highly liquid assets which totaled 45 billion at the end of the year As always we are balancing investing for longterm growth with delivering returns to our shareholders For example in 2022 we invested more than 3 billion to drive growth across our businesses while returning more than 3 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases In all since 2021 we have returned more than 75 billion to shareholders Prudential Financial Inc 2022 Annual Report 3 We are continuing to enhance returns to investors For 2023 our Board of Directors authorized 1 billion in share repurchases as well as a 4 dividend increase beginning in the first quarter representing the 15th consecutive annual increase in our dividend We remain committed to our longstanding capital management philosophy of increasing shareholder distributions as our company grows Committed to our talent culture and communities To achieve our vision and create growth over the long term we must continually strengthen and expand our selfreinforcing business system As we pursue that objective we will continue to advance sustainability on multiple fronts For us sustainability means attracting developing and retaining talented employees who share Prudential\u2019s commitment to equity and inclusion It means maintaining a strong culture of governance and always doing business the right way It demands we constantly innovate designing nextgeneration services and solutions for our customers and clients It requires us to deliver enhanced value to our shareholders and other stakeholders And it means caring for our environment and the communities in which we live and work Our employees are the cornerstone of our success That is why attracting developing and retaining outstanding talent is a top priority We also remain intent on providing an inclusive workplace that offers equitable compensation career mobility and opportunities for employees to continuously learn and grow To that end we are committed to transparency about our compensation practices and to becoming even more inclusive For example in our next annual sustainability report we again will share data detailing the composition of our US workforce by race ethnicity and gender and related compensation metrics We initiated this additional reporting so all our stakeholders \u2014 including our employees investors and customers \u2014 can measure our progress and hold us accountable This objective reflects our purpose and unique company culture which is based on integrity respect for one another and celebrating the diverse perspectives and experiences of our employees Our commitment to living our purpose also is reflected in our ongoing community involvement and philanthropy starting in our hometown of Newark NJ where Prudential was founded in 1875 Over the past decade we have invested more than 12 billion in Newark to help build thriving neighborhoods across the city and bring financial opportunity to more of its residents Following the pandemic we centralized our New Jersey operations in the city as part of our broader commitment as one of its anchor institutions We also continue to fund improvements to Newark\u2019s public spaces and support its cultural educational and social institutions We are also pressing forward to fulfill the commitments we made in 2020 to advance racial equity on behalf of our people through our businesses and in society These commitments reflect our longstanding efforts to drive social progress close the racial wealth gap and help build more vibrant and inclusive communities around the world Confident in our purpose vision and strategy In 2022 despite an unpredictable and rapidly evolving environment we advanced our transformation seized growth opportunities and stayed focused on serving our customers Working together Prudential\u2019s nearly 40000 employees will continue to build on the progress we made challenging ourselves to help more customers achieve financial resiliency and deliver increased value to our stakeholders Prudential\u2019s history \u2014 stretching back almost 150 years \u2014 is a proud reminder of what we can achieve Time and again we have shown we have the foresight and financial strength required to navigate whatever challenges come our way while continuing to invest for the future As we look to 2023 we remain grounded in our purpose confident in our vision and strategy and

KEYNOTE091 which represents its seventh indication in earlierstage cancers Early lung cancer detection and screening remain an important unmet need It is our ambition along with stakeholders to improve lung cancer screening rates to levels similar to other cancer types such as breast and colon where screening programs have been more widely adopted We have made substantial progress in advancing our oncology program through our internal RD and business development and we believe that our suite of antibodydrug conjugates and small molecules represent greater than 10 billion of commercial potential by the mid2030s This excludes additional innovation we are investing in to expand deepen and extend our current commercial assets and does not include the personalized mRNA

\u2013 reported encouraging topline results for its vaccine candidate to prevent dengue which will help inform future development of our own dengue vaccine candidate V181 which uses a similar approach with the same antigenic content In addition we have begun a Phase 3 trial of our monoclonal antibody to provide passive immunity against respiratory syncytial virus in infants Our Animal Health business remained a market leader in 2022 with consistent abovemarket growth driven by higher demand in livestock from our ruminant poultry and swine products Sales growth in companion animal reflected higher demand for the BRAVECTO parasiticide line of products We look forward to continuing to build our biopharmaceutical and technology offerings and driving growth innovation and strong performance in Animal Health Our business development strategy is helping position Merck for growth well into the next decade and complements our diverse pipeline and product portfolio In 2022 we executed several important transactions including the acquisition of Imago Biosciences and collaborations with Orion Corporation Orna Therapeutics Moderna Therapeutics and KelunBiotech We will continue to take a disciplined and focused look at opportunities to add novel assets and technologies to our portfolio in 2023 We are delivering on our longstanding commitment to operating responsibly and in 2022 we continued to make significant progress across our goals of expanding access to health developing a diverse and inclusive workforce protecting our environment and operating with the

had a truly exceptional 2022 \u2013 scientifically commercially and operationally We took transformative steps to advance global health and catalyze greater equity across the healthcare landscape We put the patient at the center of everything we did as we worked to fulfill our purpose of using the power of leadingedge science to save and improve lives around the world I am incredibly proud of how our team advanced our pipeline delivered critical medicines vaccines and innovative health solutions and added important innovation through a portfolio of strategic acquisitions collaborations and partnerships Our scienceled strategy is working and we are moving with speed as one team to deliver value for patients society and all of our stakeholders From a scientific standpoint we made exciting progress in our cardiovascular program and recently shared updates on two promising investigational medicines from our robust pipeline \u2013 sotatercept and MK0616 Sotatercept is a potential firstinclass drug for patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension \u201cPAH\u201d a rare and ultimately lifethreatening disease with a poor prognosis In fact the key driver of our acquisition of Acceleron in 2021 was the promise of this important medicine The readout from our Phase 3 STELLAR trial has been extremely encouraging Sotatercept exceeded expectations meeting the primary endpoint and achieving statistical significance on eight of nine secondary outcomes measures Sotatercept was \u201cOur success in 2022 was underpinned by our understanding that the work we do has a truly profound effect on global health Throughout the year we continued to build on our legacy of putting patients first focusing on how we can address unmet medical needs and work to prevent and treat devastating diseases\u201d studied as an addon to PAH background therapy We\u2019ve also received encouraging results from the Phase 2b trial evaluating MK0616 an oral PCSK9 inhibitor for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia As a result of these positive data we plan to move to Phase 3 in the second half of this year Our progress with sotatercept and MK0616 is also supplemented by strong momentum in other strategic areas including our Factor XI inhibitor MK2060 which received fasttrack designation from the US Food and Drug Administration FDA in August Based on these most recent data readouts and the progress we\u2019ve made across our pipeline we are even more confident in our potential to achieve greater than 10 billion in revenue from our cardiovascular program by the mid2030s Oncology products KEYTRUDA Lenvima Lynparza and WELIREG are driving key growth for our business and we remain focused on our expansive oncology research efforts including moving to earlier stages of disease where there is a higher probability of achieving improved longterm outcomes for patients In 2022 we continued our momentum with approvals for KEYTRUDA and Lynparza in additional tumor types and earlierstage cancers In collaboration with Moderna we announced that KEYTRUDA in combination with mRNA4157V940 a personalized mRNA therapeutic cancer vaccine received breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA for adjuvant treatment of certain patients with highrisk melanoma This follows results demonstrating statistically significant recurrencefree survival in the Phase 2b trial studying the combination the first demonstration of efficacy for an investigational mRNA cancer treatment in a randomized clinical trial We believe this combination has great potential for patients We also recently received approval for KEYTRUDA for adjuvant treatment after resection and platinumbased chemotherapy for certain adult patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer based on the results of KEYNOTE091 which represents its seventh indication in earlierstage cancers Early lung cancer detection and screening remain an important unmet need It is our ambition along with stakeholders to improve lung cancer screening rates to levels similar to other cancer types such as breast and colon where screening programs have been more widely adopted We have made substantial progress in advancing our oncology program through our internal RD and business development and we believe that our suite of antibodydrug conjugates and small molecules represent greater than 10 billion of commercial potential by the mid2030s This excludes additional innovation we are investing in to expand deepen and extend our current commercial assets and does not include the personalized mRNA therapeutic cancer vaccine Our vaccines business remains a key growth pillar anchored by our HPV vaccines GARDASIL and GARDASIL 9 We expect our HPV vaccines to continue growing substantially potentially more than doubling 2021 sales and generating over 11 billion Merck  Co Inc 2023 Proxy Statement 3 in revenue by 2030 Additionally we are advancing our populationspecific strategy in pneumococcal vaccines VAXNEUVANCE is approved in infants children and adults for protection against invasive pneumococcal disease and later this year we look forward to completing the Phase 3 clinical trials from our V116 program for the protection of adults against pneumococcal disease In December Instituto Butantan in Brazil \u2013 an organization we are collaborating with for vaccine development \u2013 reported encouraging topline results for its vaccine candidate to prevent dengue which will help inform future development of our own dengue vaccine candidate V181 which uses a similar approach with the same antigenic content In addition we have begun a Phase 3 trial of our monoclonal antibody to provide passive immunity against respiratory syncytial virus in infants Our Animal Health business remained a market leader in 2022 with consistent abovemarket growth driven by higher demand in livestock from our ruminant poultry and swine products Sales growth in companion animal reflected higher demand for the BRAVECTO parasiticide line of products We look forward to continuing to build our biopharmaceutical and technology offerings and driving growth innovation and strong performance in Animal Health Our business development strategy is helping position Merck for growth well into the next decade and complements our diverse pipeline and product portfolio In 2022 we executed several important transactions including the acquisition of Imago Biosciences and collaborations with Orion Corporation Orna Therapeutics Moderna Therapeutics and KelunBiotech We will continue to take a disciplined and focused look at opportunities to add novel assets and technologies to our portfolio in 2023 We are delivering on our longstanding commitment to operating responsibly and in 2022 we continued to make significant progress across our goals of expanding access to health developing a diverse and inclusive workforce protecting our environment and operating with the highest standards of ethics We expanded access to our innovative portfolio to ensure Merck\u2019s science advances global health We are more than halfway toward reaching our goal of providing 100 million more people access to our innovative portfolio globally \u2013 through access strategies solutions and partnerships by 2025 In addition recognizing the ongoing need for multiple approaches to treat COVID19 we continued to accelerate global access to LAGEVRIO through our comprehensive supply and access approach We continued to cultivate a diverse and inclusive workforce implementing critical strategies and leveraging our 10 employee business resource groups which represent the various dimensions of diversity that span our company These groups enhance employee engagement enable career growth and development and help ensure we achieve our business objectives We also made strong progress toward our climate goals and further developed the tools and processes required to reduce our company\u2019s carbon footprint And we are committed to conducting ourselves with integrity fully complying with regulatory requirements Our success in 2022 was underpinned by our understanding that the work we do has a truly profound effect on global health Throughout the year we continued to build on our legacy of putting patients first focusing on how we can address unmet medical needs and work to prevent and treat devastating diseases We will continue to leverage our size scope scale and strength to invest in our pipeline and capitalize on opportunities that deliver lifesaving and lifechanging benefits to patients worldwide as well as great returns for our shareholders I am deeply inspired by and proud of the progress we\u2019ve made Still I am keenly aware that our work is never done and that patients around the world are waiting for the kind of scientific innovation that Merck can uniquely deliver now and well into the future In 2022 we also marked the conclusion of a leadership transition as Ken Frazier retired from our company after a distinguished 30year tenure Throughout his Merck career Ken set and exceeded a high bar of excellence in both executive and board

year We delivered solid performance in every one of our businesses 2022 also capped a threeyear journey where during that time period our business and our team responded to 1 the sudden and near total

partnership\u2019s 2022 performance was generated by record volumes across many of our assets higher margins in our natural gas processing and octane enhancement businesses and contributions from our February 2022 acquisition of Navitas Midstream LLC The Navitas purchase our largest acquisition since 2014 enabled us to establish a natural gas gathering and processing presence in the Permian\u2019s active Midland Basin This acquisition was immediately accretive to Enterprise\u2019s cash flow per unit and exceeded our initial expectations During the year we increased the value of our partnership by investing 14 billion in organic growth capital projects completing 34 billion of acquisitions for Navitas and costefficient purchases of existing pipelines that expand our midstream system and repurchasing 250 million of our common units while also reducing the principal amount of our senior notes by 14 billion We finished the year with a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility that

a very different company We are an industry\r\nand market leader and we strive to set the standard in all\r\nthat we do\r\nOur 2022 Accomplishments\r\nOver the course of 2022 we made progress on many\r\nfronts reinforcing our reputation as a company that can\r\ndeliver on multiple complex priorities at the same time\r\nI am very proud of what our global colleagues accomplished\r\nBelow are a few highlights\r\n1 Our most significant accomplishment was the\r\ncompletion of the initial public offering IPO of Corebridge\r\nFinancial \u2014 the largest US IPO in 2022 \u2014 in a market\r\nwhere external dynamics were extremely challenging\r\n2 We established a standalone capital structure for\r\nCorebridge while deleveraging AIG\u2019s balance sheet These\r\nactions enhanced the strength of the balance sheets of\r\nboth companies and set the foundation for financial\r\nflexibility and delivering on financial commitments made\r\nto our respective shareholders\r\n3 AIG returned over 6 billion to shareholders through\r\n51 billion of AIG common stock repurchases and 10\r\nbillion of dividends We finished the year with 734 million\r\nshares outstanding a 10 decrease from the end of 2021\r\nCorebridge paid approximately 300 million of dividends\r\nto its shareholders from the date of its IPO through\r\nyearend 2022years and our vision for the future 4 Our General Insurance business delivered the strongest\r\nunderwriting profitability AIG has ever achieved as full\r\nyear 2022 underwriting income nearly doubled from the\r\nprior year to 20 billion This translates to more than\r\n7 billion of cumulative improvement in our underwriting\r\nprofitability since 2016\r\n5 The combined ratio of 919 and accident year\r\ncombined ratio as adjusted AYCR of 887 improved\r\n39 and 23 points respectively from the prior year The\r\nlatter marked the fulfillment of our goal to achieve a\r\nfull year sub90 AYCR following 18 consecutive quarters\r\nof improvement and four sub90 quarters in 2022\r\n6 AIG 200 our multiyear effort to improve efficiency\r\nand enhance digital effectiveness reached significant\r\nmilestones including achieving a modernized technology\r\ninfrastructure and operational capabilities while\r\nexecuting on exit runrate savings of 1 billion six months\r\nahead of schedule\r\n7 We changed the strategy and structure of our\r\ninvestment management groups at AIG and Corebridge\r\nincluding through partnerships with Blackstone and\r\nBlackRock where we are leveraging their investment\r\nexpertise and technology platforms to improve\r\nperformance Since 2021 we transferred management\r\nof approximately 50 billion and 150 billion of assets\r\nrespectively to each of these partners\r\n\u201cWe made progress on\r\nmany fronts reinforcing our\r\nreputation as a company\r\nthat can deliver on multiple\r\ncomplex priorities at the\r\nsame time\u201d\r\n8 In 2022 AIG was recognized as one of the 50 most\r\ncommunityminded companies in the United States by\r\nPoints of Light a nonpartisan global nonprofit\r\norganization that inspires equips and mobilizes millions\r\nof people to take action that changes the world\r\nLeading the Industry with Expertise\r\nThe insurance industry has always been critical to the\r\nstability of the global economy This is certainly true today\r\nin an increasingly complex environment At AIG we take\r\ngreat pride in offering exceptional risk solutions to\r\nour clients and distribution partners while prudently\r\nmanaging our balance sheet and volatility We only need to analyze 2022\u2019s Hurricane Ian to\r\nunderstand the delicate yet essential relationship that\r\ninsurance carriers reinsurance providers and distribution\r\npartners have with businesses and individuals across the\r\nglobe Hurricane Ian was a tragic event on a human level\r\nthat also left devastating physical damage From a\r\nhumanitarian perspective AIG rapidly deployed significant\r\nresources to the affected areas and provided immediate\r\nsupport and infrastructure to help individuals businesses\r\nand communities rebuild\r\nHurricane Ian also proved to be a catalyst that changed\r\nmarket dynamics even more significantly than expected\r\nIt ultimately led to shifts in the market that required the\r\nindustry to rethink capital deployment reinsurance\r\nstrategies and the commensurate changes that needed to\r\ntake place in the primary market The unprecedented levels\r\nof natural catastrophes on a global scale also significantly\r\nimpacted the reinsurance market and retrocessional\r\ncapacity This has resulted in an increased cost of capital\r\nfor the industry which impacted almost all lines of\r\nbusiness and territories regardless of loss experience\r\nIn addition very little new capital entered the market\r\nAIG navigated the complex renewal season extremely well\r\nWe knew we were in a strong position heading into\r\nJanuary 1 given the improved quality of our global\r\nportfolio coupled with our considerable efforts to reduce\r\nour gross portfolio peak exposures as well as the strong\r\npartnerships we have with reinsurance companies\r\nAIG Your Ally from Now to Next\u2122\r\nWhile AIG was transforming its core business we were\r\nalso transforming the company\u2019s

partnership\r\nwith The RA we are elevating the women\u2019s game of golf\r\nand recognizing highlighting and rewarding the\r\nachievements of these elite athletes\r\nOur Vision for the Future\r\nAIG\u2019s turnaround along with the transformation of our\r\ncore operations was impressive for many reasons We\r\nsignificantly improved the company tackling issues that\r\nhad not been

focus to deliver on our vision of providing the world\u2019s best customer experience every day enabled us to continue building longlasting relationships and deepen engagement with our customers around the world We entered the year with strong momentum enabled by the strategic decisions we made to significantly invest in our colleagues customers and brand as well as pandemic recovery tailwinds To build on that momentum we introduced a new growth plan in January 2022 with the aspiration to grow revenue and earnings over the long term at levels exceeding the already strong growth rates we had delivered before the pandemic In the first year of our growth plan total revenues net of interest expense grew 25 to reach a company record of 529 billion and we produced EPS of 985 both exceeding the guidance we set at the start of the year of 18 to 20 revenue growth and EPS of 925 to 965 for 2022 As we entered 2023 with continued momentum across our businesses American Express is a stronger company today than before the pandemic and I remain confident that we have the right strategy and the right team in place to pursue our longterm growth aspirations In reflecting on our team\u2019s outstanding performance our success comes down to three important assets our differentiated business model our talented colleagues who power that model and our global premium customer base who are at the center of everything we do Our Differentiated Business Model and Framework for Winning Our business model is unique in the payments industry and provides a number of competitive advantages that assembled together are difficult for others to replicate It is built on our leadership positions in the premium consumer and commercial payments space our integrated payments platform that connects and builds relationships with both buyers and sellers our membership model that comprises a broad array of rich benefits our global position and our worldrenowned brand In order to most effectively optimize the advantages of our differentiated business model when I became Chairman and CEO five years ago my leadership team and I established what we call our Framework for Winning a strategic document that focuses the organization on a core set of values and priorities that are most important for us to win in the marketplace The Framework clearly defines our vision and mission as well as our most critical business imperatives and how we plan to achieve them Just as important to setting out what we want to achieve the Framework also articulates how we want to achieve our goals including the leadership behaviors we expect and the core values that are the foundation of all that we do This Framework has served as our architecture for running the company and it evolves as we identify ways to build on our momentum and strengthen our culture As we mark the end of the fifth year since establishing our Framework I am proud of the progress we have made across each of our strategic imperatives leading to the exceptional results we delivered in 2022 We have strengthened our leadership with premium consumers and in the commercial payments space as a result of decisions we made before and during the pandemic to take care of our customers and invest in growth opportunities We enhanced our consumer value propositions by building out the lifestyle and experiential aspects of our products to attract a broader range of consumers We also expanded the payment and cash flow solutions we offer small and medium size enterprises to help them grow their businesses And we invested in growing and strengthening our global merchant network The results we saw in 2022 demonstrate that our investment in these areas is working We saw strong momentum in bringing in new customers to the franchise across our consumer and commercial businesses with proprietary new card acquisitions reaching a record 125 million including record acquisitions of our US Consumer Platinum and Gold cards and US Business Platinum card Our investments to broaden the lifestyle and experiential aspects of our membership model continued to resonate with younger consumers In particular Millennial and Gen Z customers who are our fastest growing customer cohort in terms of both new account acquisitions and card spending comprised over 60 of our new consumer proprietary accounts globally Customer retention remained at high levels and engagement continued to be strong with overall Card Member spending increasing 25 FXadjusted for the full year Across our portfolios credit performance also continued to be strong with delinquencies and net writeoffs remaining below prepandemic levels through the year We also strengthened our global integrated network which underpins our products and services and is a unique differentiator in the payments space We maintained virtual parity coverage in the United States  while significantly increasing our coverage outside the US We also further modernized our network which has enabled us to introduce new products including our firstever consumer digital checking product as well as launching capabilities that enable fintechs and partners to more seamlessly work with our network i ii Another key asset for American Express is our global position Before the pandemic our international consumer and commercial card issuing businesses were among our fastest growing segments To accelerate our growth and build scale outside the US we established our new International Card Services Group in 2022 bringing together the international consumer and small business card issuing businesses under a unified team The Power of Team Amex Our success in executing against our strategic priorities has been and will continue to be powered by our more than 77000 colleagues around the world They are the heart and soul of our organization and they work with commitment and passion to deliver on our vision That is why we consider the most important part of our Framework for Winning our priority to attract develop and engage the best colleagues \u2013 not just in our own sector but across all industries \u2013 who live our Blue Box Values Our Blue Box Values define what we stand for and guide how we operate They reinforce our focus on backing our customers our respect for each other our commitments to embracing diversity and standing for equity and inclusion and most importantly doing what is right To back our colleagues we continued to invest in them in 2022 building on the wide range of learning and development opportunities and enhancing our competitive benefits in key areas including holistic health and wellness total compensation and flexibility As a result 90 of our colleagues said in a recent survey that the benefits and programs offered by American Express support their wellbeing and 92 would recommend our company as a great place to work Additionally 89 of colleagues said they have a feeling of belonging at American Express an increase from the prior year We were pleased to achieve our results in a year in which we all transitioned to our new way of working In planning our return to our offices after the pandemic we wanted to retain the best of what we learned working virtually while also recapturing the benefits of working together in person To that end last year we launched Amex Flex our new working model that gives colleagues the ability to work fully virtual fully in an office or a hybrid schedule As we mark the first anniversary of Amex Flex I am pleased that while the way we work has evolved our culture has endured A majority of our colleagues have selected a hybrid schedule which means they have chosen to come into an office on certain days and work virtually on the others while other colleagues have chosen to be mostly or entirely virtual Our flexible approach is a key differentiator for us and our continuous efforts to create an inclusive culture that embraces diversity has continued to earn us accolades In 2022 American Express ranked No 8 on the 100 Best Companies to Work For list in the US by Great Place to Work and Fortune magazine and ranked similarly high on several other workplace lists outside the US The company also ranked No 13 on Fortune\u2019s list of the World\u2019s Most Admired Companies To remain competitive we will continue to listen and evolve our approach to deliver the best experience for our colleagues so that they can deliver the best experience for our customers Backing Our Customers Our customers are at the center of everything we do and they represent one of our most critical competitive advantages in the fastgrowing payments space We are leaders in the most attractive customer segments in the industry including premium consumers small and mediumsized businesses and the largest corporations around the world Our focus on these segments has enabled American Express to create a virtuous cycle of growth that starts with our premium customers The high levels of engagement that we drive with our customers enables us to attract a growing network of merchants and partners who add more value to our membership model which in turn enables us to attract more premium customers creating more scale This scale enables us to generate more investment capacity and operating efficiencies to continue building our membership model making it difficult for our competitors to catch up What\u2019s truly special about our business is the relationship that our customers have with our brand Many of our customers don\u2019t see themselves as simply having or using American Express\u00ae cards They feel they are with American Express Our customers have a strong emotional connection to our brand and the products and services we offer They are proud of their association with us I often have people tell me how long they\u2019ve been a member when I first meet them As we have continuously evolved our membership model by adding more offerings benefits experiences and digital solutions to meet the changing needs and expectations of our customers the power of our brand endures and remains relevant across generations I\u2019m proud that our colleagues\u2019 continued commitment to customerfocused product innovation and delivering a great customer experience that once again earned our team top accolades In 2022 customers rated American Express No 1 in customer satisfaction in the JD Power US Credit Card Satisfaction Study among national credit card issuers landing the top spot for the 12th time in the 16 years since the survey began Customers also rated us No 1 in the JD Power US Small Business Credit Card Satisfaction Study for the second year in a row iii We see many opportunities ahead for our business and we intend to capture these opportunities and build on our momentum by continuing to invest at high levels in several key areas including further innovating our consumer and small business products growing merchant acceptance with a particular focus outside the US introducing new digital capabilities that deliver seamless customer experiences in their channels of choice and expanding into adjacent areas that reinforce our core membership model including new lifestyle and financial services for consumers and SMEs Remaining Focused Looking ahead we are focused on building on our momentum to achieve our longterm growth aspirations and remaining disciplined and nimble to meet our customers\u2019 evolving needs While there are uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment we have the right strategy and team in place to navigate changes in the operating environment should they occur Our company has shown resiliency in the face of disruption throughout the years including more recent events like the September 11 terrorist attacks the Great Financial Crisis and the COVID19 pandemic Each time we have emerged a stronger more focused company and that is because of our commitment to backing our colleagues and our customers Having just completed my fifth year as Chairman and CEO I have never felt more inspired and proud to lead American Express and the incredibly talented colleagues who make our company so special We have numerous opportunities ahead to continue deepening and strengthening our relationships with our customers I am confident that by staying true to our vision focusing on our strategic imperatives and living our Blue Box Values American Express will continue to succeed well into the future","Letter_word_count":[120,98,93,73,54,52,51,29,28,21,20,19,19,19,18,15,14,12,12,12,12,11,11,11,11,11,10,10,10,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],"OpenPrice":149.54,"ClosePrice":173.76,"PriceChange":24.22,"YearWordCount":[17,9,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]},{"Rank":78,"Company":"Publix

Carolina Our communities Mr George believed in the importance of building a thriving community and conserving our resources We continue to follow his philosophies in being responsible citizens in our communities and intolerant of waste Feeding our neighbors As part of our Feeding More Together campaign our customers and associates donate at the register and Publix matches their contributions with an equivalent value of fresh produce Since the start of this campaign in 2021 we\u2019ve provided more than 232 million meals to help feed our neighbors in need Since 2009 as part of our perishable recovery program we\u2019ve given more than 650 million meals to our neighbors in need through Feeding America member food banks and other nonprofit organizations We continue to evaluate how to give more by analyzing food that is still good to eat but unsalable We\u2019ve been able to expand the types of food we\u2019re donating and we\u2019ve added new methods that can be used to transport the food allowing for more frequent pickups from our stores Last year during Hunger Action Month in September Publix Super Markets Charities announced a 565 million donation to 328 food banks and other nonprofit organizations focused on hunger alleviation In a joint effort Publix and Publix Charities announced plans to do more good together to alleviate hunger Publix Charities donated an additional 385 million to 22 Feeding America member food banks for each to purchase and equip a mobile food pantry to help provide fresh food to the people they serve As part of Publix\u2019s investment in our communities we will provide more than 10 million pounds of produce to stock 20 of the mobile pantries in their first year of operation Through these collective efforts individuals will be able to shop these free pantries for the food that meets their needs To further support hunger alleviation efforts nearly 6300 associates volunteered with more than 200 nonprofit organizations throughout our operating area during our fall Publix Serves Week And at the end of last month we hosted a hunger summit with Feeding America member food banks in our operating area The summit\u2019s goal was to provide a forum for open discussion and sharing of best practices in different areas important to their success including logistics warehousing and transportation This was an opportunity to build stronger connections and together find better ways to accomplish a united purpose \u2014 feeding even more people in need in the communities we serve Improving the environment Mr George was in a green routine before it was popular and for decades we\u2019ve focused on ways to reduce reuse and recycle because we know how important it is for our environment We\u2019ve focused our sustainability efforts on five pillars water stewardship plastics and packaging energy conservation landfill diversion and responsible sourcing We consistently implement initiatives to support those pillars from evaluating lowirrigation landscaping to working to convert recycled plastic bags to furniture 4 Last year Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary in the western Everglades and the saline glades region in the eastern section of the Everglades National Park began seeing the effects of a portion of our 2 million donation \u2014 water has returned to areas that needed it allowing wildlife to survive and thrive in their natural habitat For the sixth year in a row we supported the restoration of damaged Florida watersheds by donating to the Arbor Day Foundation Our donation allowed for planting 126000 longleaf pine saplings near north central Florida areas nearly stripped of trees by Hurricane Michael in 2018 Since 2016 more than 730000 trees have been planted in four damaged Florida watersheds through our donations We also enhanced our commitment to marine life conservation by collaborating with Sustainable Fisheries Partnership SFP to analyze and understand current fishing practices within the supply chain Last year was our 12th year donating to SFP Over that time we\u2019ve contributed more than 600000 to support fishery and aquaculture improvement projects and other initiatives to advance the sustainability of seafood Among other efforts we were the first US retailer to join with SFP BirdLife International and Whale and Dolphin Conservation to review and understand the risks from the unintended catch of ocean wildlife within the seafood sourcing supply chain Publix provided additional support toward efforts to test innovative new fishing gear improve data collection and increase monitoring to protect sharks whales and sea turtles And last March more than 6200 associates throughout our operating area volunteered at more than 220 state parks and other nonprofit

on three\r\nbroad initiatives Evolution\r\nExpansion and Execution\r\nEVOLUTION\r\nIn 2023 we will progress toward\r\nour goal of offering symmetrical\r\nand multigigabit speeds across\r\nour footprint By the end of\r\n2025 we expect that over 85\r\nof our footprint will be capable\r\nof delivering 5 Gbps download\r\nspeeds with at least 1 Gbps\r\nupload speeds with many areas\r\noffering

passing\r\nAdditionally we are evolving our\r\ngotomarket approach with\r\nincreasing convergence of our\r\nInternet and mobile products\r\nIn 2022 we launched Spectrum\r\nOne a highvalue package that\r\ncombines our Internet Advanced\r\nWiFi and mobile products into one\r\nproduct delivering the fastest\r\nmost seamless connectivity Our\r\nnew converged offering helped\r\ndrive strong growth in mobile\r\nlines in 2022 The potential for our\r\nmobile product to be a significant\r\ndriver of new Internet sales\r\nremains largely untapped but we\r\nare confident that our

For the full EXPANSION\r\nOur second area of focus is the\r\nexpansion of our footprint Line\r\nextension construction is an\r\nimportant part of our 2023 and\r\nbeyond growth plan It offers\r\ngood

rural\r\npassings constructed in 20222\r\n and\r\npenetration of passings open at\r\nleast six months averaging about\r\n40 In 2023 the pace of new\r\nrural passing construction will\r\naccelerate and we plan to bid on\r\nadditional state and local grants\r\nWe also expect to participate\r\nin the 425 billion Broadband\r\nEquity Access and Deployment\r\nBEAD Program assuming a\r\nreasonable regulatory framework\r\nAdditionally we remain focused on\r\nexpansion opportunities inside our\r\nexisting footprint\r\nUltimately our rural construction\r\ninitiative is not only good for the\r\nmillions of rural consumers that\r\nwill finally have access to fast and\r\nreliable Internet but it is also good\r\nfor Charter and its shareholders\r\nThe expansion of our footprint will\r\nhelp us drive additional customer\r\ngrowth and strong financial returns\r\nEXECUTION\r\nFinally we remain focused on\r\nexecuting our core operating\r\nstrategy \u2013 further improving the\r\ncustomer experience raising\r\ncustomer satisfaction and driving\r\ncustomer growth In 2023 we will\r\ncontinue to invest in areas that\r\nenhance the customer experience\r\nincluding the continued\r\ndigitization of our customer\r\nservice model accelerating our\r\nproactive maintenance initiative\r\nand investing in training and\r\ntenure for our employees We\r\nbelieve that further

operating\r\nmodel to address the opportunities\r\nin front of us It is the same strategy\r\nthat we have deployed for years\r\nIt involves having the fastest\r\nconnectivity and products pricing\r\nand packaging that are difficult to\r\nreplicate by our competitors We\r\nbelieve this model ultimately year 2022 we added 344000 net new Internet customers despite the previous leads to higher penetration\r\nacross our passings and the\r\nplacement of more products into\r\nthe households we serve which\r\nwhen combined with highquality\r\nservice drives higher longterm\r\nrecurring cash flow\r\nIn closing the outlook for Charter\r\nremains very bright and I am\r\nboth honored and excited by\r\nthe opportunity to continue\r\nto help Charter grow and to\r\ncreate shareholder value

records for the company including product orders ending backlog net income EPS Annualized Recurring Revenue ARR and Remaining Performance Obligations RPO These were strong results particularly considering the incredibly dynamic environment in which we continue to operate This tells me that our investments in accelerated innovation continued strong customer demand and our ability to execute with excellence put us in a position of strength for the year ahead and\u00a0beyond We were delighted to engage with our customers in person once again at Cisco Live and other events throughout the year and we continue to hear that their technology priorities have become even more urgent In this massively distributed world of hybrid work and hybrid cloud the Internet of Things is exploding more and more devices are being connected via the network and the cyber threat landscape is shifting and expanding Our customers need to reimagine their applications power hybrid work secure their enterprise and transform their infrastructure We are committed to being a trusted partner on their digital transformation journeys and doing all we can to help them succeed Navigating through

significant supply constraints Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and rising inflation\u2014have only reinforced our focus on what matters most helping our customers and partners our people and the

productivity and economic growth We have the opportunity\u2014and the responsibility\u2014to leverage the power of technology in this new reality to continue to drive transformation and to solve some of the world\u2019s biggest\u00a0problems I am confident the decisions we made and the multiple actions we took over the past two years are helping to offset cost inflation and improve our resiliency These include adding new and leveraging alternative suppliers redesigning hundreds of products to use available components with similar capabilities targeted price increases and several other creative

Edge SASE and eases daytoday operations through a cloudmanaged platform is a great example and the latest of several asaservice offers and we have more in the pipeline Successfully transforming our\u00a0business We continue to make solid progress in our business transformation which we believe is strengthening our position in the market by helping us to deliver innovation and choice for our customers in new ways all while giving us greater visibility resiliency and predictability In fiscal 2022 we generated over 15 billion of software revenue 81 of which was subscriptionbased Total subscription revenue including services sold as subscriptions was over 22 billion and represented 43 of Cisco\u2019s total revenue Our subscription revenue drives ARR and RPO which are the best indicators of our progress in our business transformation The combination of our ARR RPO and our record backlog gives us excellent visibility and a high degree of confidence in our future\u00a0revenues Living our purpose Since the beginning Cisco has focused on innovation integrity and doing what\u2019s right By operating a successful business we are empowered to step up to the many societal and environmental challenges we see around the world We redefined our purpose\u2014to power an inclusive future for all\u2014in 2020 and we couldn\u2019t have imagined how relevant it would be in today\u2019s world To help fulfill our purpose we leverage our technology and catalyze our networks partners and people to make a positive impact in communities worldwide and on the planet Our purpose guides us to focus our efforts where we know we can make most impact This past year we committed to reaching netzero greenhouse gas emissions across our value chain by 2040 We recently refined our goals and nearterm targets and were one of the first technology and hardware equipment companies to have its netzero goals validated under the Science Based Targets initiative SBTi NetZero Standard the worlds first framework for corporate netzero target setting in line with climate science The use of our sold products is the greatest contributor to our overall carbon footprint so improving the energy efficiency of our hardware and solutions\u2014by integrating Silicon One across our portfolio for example\u2014is a high priority as it also helps our customers meet their own emissions reduction goals We also remain committed to doing all we can to provide inclusive access to training and education in the key digital skills that are in such high demand across all industries In the 25 years since we launched the Cisco Networking Academy in 1997 we have reached more than 17 million students 95 of whom say the program helped them obtain a job or educational opportunity This past year to accommodate even more students we created SkillsForAllcom providing free online technology courses backed by Cisco\u2019s expertise and connected to real career paths in the digital economy Im incredibly proud of how our teams around the world have rallied around our purpose During this past year more than 80 of employees have given back to their communities I have no doubt that our purposedriven culture is a primary reason why Cisco has been named the number one Great Place to Work in 14 countries around the world While we continue to make good progress on our priorities and work in service of our purpose we recognize there is always much more to be done to ensure that people and ecosystems can thrive together on a liveable\u00a0planet Confidence in the future As we enter fiscal 2023 we see tremendous opportunity ahead While we expect supply chain challenges to persist we are encouraged by the early signs of supply easing that we saw at the end of fiscal 2022 and we expect to see gradual improvements throughout the year that will enable us to get our products into our customers\u2019 hands\u00a0faster We will continue to focus on simplification as we develop our platform strategy and offerings while helping to drive sustainability in our products There is a greater sense of urgency from our customers and partners to leverage leadingedge technologies to deliver on their strategic objectives and our innovation is helping them navigate an increasing amount of complexity While no company is immune to macro trends we are fortunate that there are currently more technology transitions occurring concurrently than I\u2019ve seen in 20 years Given the strength of our portfolio our continued investment in accelerated innovation and the commitment of our teams we believe the multiyear megatrends of hybrid cloud hybrid work security IoT 400G and beyond 5G and WiFi 6 as well as the move towards application observability will provide tailwinds to our longterm growth We also believe that the focus on sustainability and the climate crisis will continue to be positive for our business We feel that Cisco is well positioned for

calculated by taking our overall expense ratio and subtracting media costs and agent commissions Our Personal Lines and Property NAER for 2022 was down approximately 02 points and 03 points respectively from 2021 while Commercial Lines NAER was up approximately 02 points in 2022 versus 2021 We believe we maintain some of the most competitive NAERs in the industry which naturally supports competitive prices that allow us to grow We balance our loss adjustment expense LAE with providing excellent service and claims accuracy paying the right amount for every claim We continually try to manage to the optimal combination of these three principles along with strong engagement and work environment for our employees While we are pleased with our relative competitive position around NAER and LAE we recognize the ratios benefited from higher written premium per policy in 2022 Our employees are one of our most significant expenses and at yearend 2022 the ratio of our policies in force to headcount was 8 lower than at yearend 2021 We are focused on making our processes more efficient and building experiences to be more conducive to selfservice to improve productivity and operational efficiency going forward Taking a holistic view our 2022 companywide expense ratio was 185 points or 11 points lower than in 2021 While we had some improvement in our NAER as we navigated the effects of Hurricane Ian and sustained loss trends we reduced our media budget to help ensure we achieved our aggregate calendar year 96 combined ratio Another important facet of competitive prices is to be able to price rate to risk through our product models and strong segmentation Our investment in product development is a key tactic to accomplish that In auto we launched our newest product model which we refer to as 88 By the end of 2022 we had this product model rolled out in 10 states which represented over 25 of our 2022 countrywide NPW and almost 27 of our policies in force Within our commercial auto product we completed 25 commercial auto model upgrades during the year and our latest product design 80 at year end 2022 was deployed in 37 states that represented nearly 85 of our countrywide premium Our 80 product model greatly improves segmentation delivering lower rates for the best risks while also introducing several new coverages In stark contrast to the commercial auto industry we believe that our continued rate actions over the last few years have enabled us to consistently stay ahead of net trend ensuring consistent profitable growth In Property we continue to invest heavily in the development of our next product model 50 which will also provide improvement in segmentation The first state is expected to launch in the second quarter of 2023 As we head into 2023 we will continue to invest in technology and process improvements to attempt to push nonacquisition expense ratios lower and in talent to continue to improve our segmentation acumen ONWARD AND

Good Morning Tricia I wanted to take a moment to tell you how blessed I feel to be able to work for such an amazing Company I like many was hit by the recent hurricane Ian Words can\u2019t begin to describe the feelings you have during such an event Within two hours of the storm I lost all power cell phones went down as well as Internet The ability to have any communication cut off is the most unsettling feeling I think I have ever experienced I was lucky to have a great group of neighbors and we rallied together in one house to brave the storm After a long afternoon and night when the storm had passed one neighbor had cell service I was able to alert my family and loved ones finally that I was OK I viewed my emails to see over 20 emails from Progressive trying to check if I was ok as well from my direct Supervisor Vincent The first glance at the devastating damages was beyond overwhelming Over the next week so many people reached out to me from Progressive to see what they could do to help Crysti from HR was amazing as she talked with me every day even if it was to say a kind word She was so supportive and uplifting Rob our senior claims leader called as well as texted to let me know what ever I needed Progressive was there for me Vincent was amazing He was in constant contact with me two to three times a day offering whatever he could do to help even offering to drive two hours to bring gas to me as gas was almost impossible to get He went above and beyond As the weeks have past and the rebuild is ongoing I still tear up thinking about Progressive and the people I work with They are my Family People say when things are really bad that is when you find out what people are made of That being said Progressive people are amazing kind caring and most of all selfless I am so proud to say I work for Progressive and for sure Progressive works for me Thank you for your time in reading this I felt it was important to know how blessed Progressive is to have

calculated by taking our overall expense ratio and subtracting media costs and agent commissions Our Personal Lines and Property NAER for 2022 was down approximately 02 points and 03 points respectively from 2021 while Commercial Lines NAER was up approximately 02 points in 2022 versus 2021 We believe we maintain some of the most competitive NAERs in the industry which naturally supports competitive prices that allow us to grow We balance our loss adjustment expense LAE with providing excellent service and claims accuracy paying the right amount for every claim We continually try to manage to the optimal combination of these three principles along with strong engagement and work environment for our employees While we are pleased with our relative competitive position around NAER and LAE we recognize the ratios benefited from higher written premium per policy in 2022 Our employees are one of our most significant expenses and at yearend 2022 the ratio of our policies in force to headcount was 8 lower than at yearend 2021 We are focused on making our processes more efficient and building experiences to be more conducive to selfservice to improve productivity and operational efficiency going forward Taking a holistic view our 2022 companywide expense ratio was 185 points or 11 points lower than in 2021 While we had some improvement in our NAER as we navigated the effects of Hurricane Ian and sustained loss trends we reduced our media budget to help ensure we achieved our aggregate calendar year 96 combined ratio Another important facet of competitive prices is to be able to price rate to risk through our product models and strong segmentation Our investment in product development is a key tactic to accomplish that In auto we launched our newest product model which we refer to as 88 By the end of 2022 we had this product model rolled out in 10 states which represented over 25 of our 2022 countrywide NPW and almost 27 of our policies in force Within our commercial auto product we completed 25 commercial auto model upgrades during the year and our latest product design 80 at year end 2022 was deployed in 37 states that represented nearly 85 of our countrywide premium Our 80 product model greatly improves segmentation delivering lower rates for the best risks while also introducing several new coverages In stark contrast to the commercial auto industry we believe that our continued rate actions over the last few years have enabled us to consistently stay ahead of net trend ensuring consistent profitable growth In Property we continue to invest heavily in the development of our next product model 50 which will also provide improvement in segmentation The first state is expected to launch in the second quarter of 2023 As we head into 2023 we will continue to invest in technology and process improvements to attempt to push nonacquisition expense ratios lower and in talent to continue to improve our segmentation acumen ONWARD AND UPWARD While Hurricane Ian was certainly a gut punch to so many there are always silver linings and the note sent to me below proves what it means to live our Core Values specifically the Golden Rule Good Morning Tricia I wanted to take a moment to tell you how blessed I feel to be able to work for such an amazing Company I like many was hit by the recent hurricane Ian Words can\u2019t begin to describe the feelings you have during such an event Within two hours of the storm I lost all power cell phones went down as well as Internet The ability to have any communication cut off is the most unsettling feeling I think I have ever experienced I was lucky to have a great group of neighbors and we rallied together in one house to brave the storm After a long afternoon and night when the storm had passed one neighbor had cell service I was able to alert my family and loved ones finally that I was OK I viewed my emails to see over 20 emails from Progressive trying to check if I was ok as well from my direct Supervisor Vincent The first glance at the devastating damages was beyond overwhelming Over the next week so many people reached out to me from Progressive to see what they could do to help Crysti from HR was amazing as she talked with me every day even if it was to say a kind word She was so supportive and uplifting Rob our senior claims leader called as well as texted to let me know what ever I needed Progressive was there for me Vincent was amazing He was in constant contact with me two to three times a day offering whatever he could do to help even offering to drive two hours to bring gas to me as gas was almost impossible to get He went above and beyond As the weeks have past and the rebuild is ongoing I still tear up thinking about Progressive and the people I work with They are my Family People say when things are really bad that is when you find out what people are made of That being said Progressive people are amazing kind caring and most of all selfless I am so proud to say I work for Progressive and for sure Progressive works for me Thank you for your time in reading this I felt it was important to know how blessed Progressive is to have such amazing people work for them God bless Notes like this and reflecting on these past three years I can\u2019t tell you how enthusiastic I am to dive into 2023 We believe we are well prepared and positioned This is what we do\u2014execute on deliberate and cogent plans with room for flexibility as the unknowns inevitably occur Words do not do justice to literally every single area of Progressive that contributed to this year and the prior years that I have referenced Instead of calling out every group because I\u2019m certain I would accidentally overlook an area I just want to

global pandemic\r\nI am proud to report that Best Buy navigated these\r\nobstacles by doing what we do best focusing\r\non our customers investing in our strengths and\r\nplanning a definitive course for the future\r\nWe quickly pivoted operations during another\r\ncomplex year overshadowed by macroeconomic\r\nheadwinds We faced the challenges head on\r\nusing the same approach that has served us well\r\nin recent years Balancing our nearterm response\r\nto current conditions and managing what is in our\r\ncontrol while advancing our strategic initiatives\r\nand investing in areas critical to our longterm\r\ngrowth\r\nBefore I proceed further let me take this\r\nopportunity to thank our amazing employees for\r\nthe dedication and resilience they continue to\r\nshow in this everchanging environment Every\r\nday our management team and employees\r\nacross the company make difficult tradeoff\r\ndecisions while providing amazing customer\r\nexperiences Through all this uncertainty I am\r\nso proud of the way our team has always kept\r\nour customers as our top priority It\u2019s because of\r\nthe tireless work of this team that Best Buy can\r\ncontinue to evolve and grow into an even more\r\nvibrant company\r\nI believe this commitment is driven by our\r\nshared connection to our company purpose \u2014 a\r\npurpose that is more relevant today than ever to\r\nenrich lives through technology\r\nFrom a financial results standpoint we finished\r\nFY23 slightly better than the updated expectations\r\nwe provided midway through the year as the\r\nenvironment evolved We returned 18 billion\r\nto shareholders through share repurchases and\r\ndividends We increased our quarterly dividend\r\nto 092 per share which represents the tenth\r\nconsecutive year of regular quarterly dividend\r\nincreases\r\nI am also excited to share that we reached our\r\ntarget of achieving 1 billion in annualized cost\r\nreductions during FY23 two years ahead of the\r\ngoal we set in 2019 We continue to use these\r\ncost savings to make strategic investments and\r\nnavigate other pressures that affect our business\r\nWe began FY23 with an investor update outlining\r\nBest Buy\u2019s path forward In that update we shared\r\nthree reasons why we believe our strategy is the\r\nright one to deliver growth and longterm value for\r\nall our stakeholders\r\n1 Technology is a necessity and we are the only\r\nnational tech solutions provider for the home\r\n2 We have built a unique ecosystem of\r\ncustomercentric assets delivering\r\nexperiences that no one else can\r\n3 Our differentiated abilities and ongoing\r\ninvestments in our business are designed to\r\nlead to compelling financial returns over time These three points remain truer today than\r\never before While we are preparing for another\r\nchallenging year for the industry as a whole we\r\nalso believe that this calendar year will be the\r\nbottom of the decline in tech demand\r\nWith this in mind on behalf of my leadership team\r\nlet me state clearly that we are optimistic about the\r\nfuture in part because of the following reasons\r\n1 Households have twice as many connected\r\ndevices as they did before the pandemic\r\nDeloitte \u201cMastering the New Digital Life 2022\r\nConnectivity and Mobile Trends 3rd Edition\u201d\r\n2 Tech is increasingly viewed more as a\r\nfunctional need versus an emotional want\r\n3 Upgrade and replacement cycles in the\r\nConsumer Electronics category are historically\r\nthree to seven years so many of those recently\r\npurchased devices will likely be eligible for an\r\nupgrade soon\r\n4 Innovation is normalizing after having been\r\nlargely paused since the beginning of the\r\npandemic This will likely take shape in two\r\nways Stimulating upgradesreplacements and\r\ncreating new categories\r\n5 Structural innovations like cloud augmented\r\nreality broadband infrastructure funding and\r\nthe electrification of our homes and vehicles\r\nwill continue to drive demand\r\nThese factors align well with our vision to\r\nhumanize and personalize technology for every\r\nstage of life We continue our own expansion\r\ninto newer categories like wellness and electric\r\ntransportation and our employees provide the\r\nadvice our customers need to make the best\r\ndecision for their needs We are the technology\r\nexperts and remain the best place for people\r\nto see and try the latest products and get tech\r\nsupport even in their own homes\r\nWe intend not only to maintain that reputation but\r\nalso to build on it In keeping with our approach\r\nto manage today while investing for tomorrow\r\nwe are focused on five strategic areas in FY24\r\n\u2022 Building customer relationships through\r\nmembership We will continue to evolve our\r\nofferings to create longlasting connections\r\nwith customers that align with their wants\r\nand needs Millions of customers belong to\r\nour My Best Buy and Totaltech programs\r\nand we are seeing increased engagement\r\nhigher spending with us and more crosscategory buying than from nonmembers\r\n\u2022 Evolving our omnichannel retail model\r\nOver the past three years we have seen our\r\ndigital sales increase significantly and they\r\nnow make up onethird of our total domestic\r\nsales At the same time our stores remain\r\na cornerstone asset Based on successful\r\npilots in several markets we are rolling out\r\na new approach to our stores and staffing\r\nWe are moving away from a \u201conesizefitsall\u201d model to serving defined geographic\r\nareas with the right mix of store formats\r\nand fulfillment solutions that best serve the\r\ncustomers who live there\r\n\u2022 Incubating and growing Best Buy Health\r\nWe\u2019re building on our early successes in\r\nthis space by leveraging our unique assets\r\nincluding the Geek Squad to enable care\r\nat home for everyone throughout their\r\nhealth journey Partnerships with some\r\nof the nation\u2019s largest health systems are\r\naccelerating our footprint in the market\r\n\u2022 Unlocking reverse secondary market\r\nopportunities By refurbishing and reselling\r\nnonnew inventory we believe Best Buy will\r\nbe able to create new revenue streams and\r\nappeal to a larger customer base This also\r\naligns with our priority of contributing to a\r\ncircular economy a system that promotes\r\nusing fewer new natural resources keeping\r\nproducts and materials in use as long\r\nas possible and finding alternatives to\r\nthrowing them away\r\n\u2022 Removing cost and improving efficiency\r\nand effectiveness As mentioned earlier\r\ndriving profitability across our business and\r\neliminating unnecessary spending allows us\r\nto make investments to fuel our future\r\nAs you can see we are investing despite these\r\nturbulent times Our investments build on our\r\noneofakind suite of capabilities that allows\r\nus to create customer experiences no one else\r\ncan In fact our customer satisfaction scores tell\r\nus that we delivered better experiences across\r\nmany areas this past holiday season than last\r\nyear and the prepandemic fourth quarter of\r\nFY20 especially within our services and delivery\r\nexperiences All of this work continues our proven\r\ntrack record of managing through challenges to\r\nbecome a stronger company on the other side\r\nTo be clear it\u2019s Best Buy\u2019s culture and incredible\r\nteams of employees that make this possible and\r\nmake us confident in our future\r\nWe know our employees and the expert\r\nservice they provide are our core competitive\r\ndifferentiator and we remain focused on being a\r\nbest place to work I am proud that our employee\r\nretention rates continue to outperform the retail\r\nindustry and remain low especially in crucial areas\r\nlike store general managers\r\nCompetitive compensation continues to be\r\ncritical to attracting and retaining top talent and\r\nwe have increased our store associate hourly pay\r\nby approximately 25 in the last three years We\r\nalso provide training and opportunities for our\r\nemployees to upskill and reskill so they can work\r\nmore flexibly and pick the career path best for\r\nthem at Best Buy I am also incredibly proud that\r\n60 of our general managers started their Best\r\nBuy careers in nonleadership roles and 94 of\r\nour general managers and assistant managers\r\nhere today were hired internally\r\nFrom a community standpoint we celebrated\r\na milestone this year the Best Buy Foundation\r\nsaw the opening of its 52nd Best Buy Teen Tech\r\nCenter\u00ae That puts the foundation more than\r\nhalfway to its goal of building 100 locations\r\nacross the United States by 2025 These centers\r\ncontinue to provide young people with the access\r\ninspiration and opportunity they deserve to help\r\nthem define their futures And we know they work\r\nOn average 95 of Teen Tech Center members\r\nplan to continue their education after high school\r\nand 71 have an increased interest in studying\r\nSTEM fields Science Technology Engineering\r\nand Math\r\nI am proud to say that Best Buy continues to be\r\nrecognized for the many ways we are supporting\r\nour employees and communities We ranked\r\n34th and were the No 1 retailer on the JUST\r\nCapital list that evaluates and ranks the largest\r\npublicly traded companies in the US in part on\r\nhow a company invests in its workers supports\r\nits communities and minimizes environmental\r\nimpact And for the eighth time we were named\r\nto the Ethisphere World\u2019s Most Ethical Companies\r\nlist which recognizes companies based on\r\nculture environmental and social practices ethics\r\nand compliance activities and diversity initiatives\r\nWe were one of only three retailers on the list of\r\n136 companies from 22 countries Click here\r\nto view our FY22 ESG Report We publish a new\r\nreport every

record of outstanding performance\r\nIn 2022 we grew our revenue by 15 percent to\r\n4492 billion delivered strong earnings results\r\nconsisting of GAAP diluted earnings per share EPS\r\nof 1763 and adjusted EPS\u00b9 of 2324 and we\r\ngenerated very strong free cash flow\u00b9 of 694 billion\r\nWe also returned significant capital to our\r\nshareholders through 35 billion of stock\r\nbuybacks and dividends\r\nOur continued success is propelled by our proven\r\ngrowth strategy which consists of three pillars\r\n\u2022 Developing highimpact innovative new products\r\n\u2022 Leveraging our scale in highgrowth and emerging\r\nmarkets\r\n\u2022 Delivering a unique value proposition to our customers\r\nWe continued to execute this strategy during 2022\r\nand the investments we\u2019ve made are driving growth\r\nand generating strong returns I\u2019ll review our progress\r\nwithin the three pillars\r\nCommitment to highimpact innovation\r\nBeginning with the first pillar our focus on highimpact innovation enables our customers to address\r\nsome of the world\u2019s greatest challenges and in\r\n2022 we invested 15 billion in RD to deliver new technologies across our businesses that are helping\r\nour customers achieve their goals There are so\r\nmany great examples from the year and I\u2019ll highlight\r\njust a few\r\nIn chromatography and mass spectrometry we\r\nextended our industryleading Thermo Scientific\r\nOrbitrap portfolio launching the Orbitrap Ascend\r\nTribrid mass spectrometer to advance proteomics\r\nmetabolomics and cancer biomarker research We\r\nalso launched the Thermo Scientific TRACE 1600\r\nSeries Gas Chromatograph to increase productivity\r\nin analytical testing for food environmental\r\nindustrial and pharmaceutical applications In\r\nelectron microscopy we launched the Thermo\r\nScientific Glacios 2 CryoTEM transmission electron\r\nmicroscope to help our customers accelerate\r\nstructurebased drug discovery for debilitating\r\ndisorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s Parkinson\u2019s and\r\nHuntington\u2019s diseases as well as research for cancer\r\nand gene mutations In bioproduction we launched\r\nthe Gibco CTS DynaCellect Magnetic Separation\r\nSystem to support cell and gene therapy programs\r\nIt was truly a spectacular year of innovation and we\r\nhave an exciting pipeline of new products that will be\r\nlaunched in 2023 and beyond\r\nLeveraging our scale\r\nThe second pillar of our growth strategy is leveraging\r\nour scale in highgrowth and emerging markets to\r\ncreate a differentiated experience for our customers\r\nDuring the year we continued to strengthen our\r\ncapabilities serving these markets\r\nTo support customers in China and the AsiaPacific\r\nregion we opened a new biologics manufacturing\r\nfacility in Hangzhou China which provides\r\nintegrated clinical and commercial drug substance\r\nand drug product capabilities We also opened a\r\nnew Bioprocess Supply Center in Incheon South\r\nKorea to provide customers with key materials for\r\nproduction of their biopharmaceuticals while also\r\nexpanding our clinical trial services there\r\nOur scale and expanding capabilities in these\r\nregions will create growth opportunities for us well\r\ninto the future Creating value for our customers\r\nOur third pillar is delivering a unique value proposition\r\nfor our customers and we continue to strengthen our\r\ncapabilities to serve them\r\nDuring 2022 we executed on the accelerated\r\ninvestments we\u2019ve made over the last three years\r\nbringing new capacity online for pharma services\r\nbioproduction and clinical research services\r\nIn pharma services we opened a manufacturing\r\nfacility in Plainville Massachusetts for the\r\ndevelopment testing and production of viral vectors\r\nused in cell and gene therapies\r\nIn bioproduction we brought new capacity online in\r\nLebanon Tennessee and Millersburg Pennsylvania\r\nfor singleuse technologies used in the production of\r\nbiologic drugs We added cellculture manufacturing\r\ncapacity in Grand Island New York and opened a\r\nfacility in Chelmsford Massachusetts where we\u2019ll\r\nmake resin beads used in the production of vaccines\r\nand breakthrough treatments for rheumatoid arthritis\r\nmultiple sclerosis asthma and other diseases\r\nWe also integrated new capabilities that we\u2019ve\r\nadded through MA including recombinant proteins\r\nto complement our biosciences offering from the\r\nacquisition of PeproTech which we completed at the\r\nclose of 2021 In addition our integration of PPD which we acquired\r\nin 2021 has been very successful and is largely\r\ncomplete PPD forms our clinical research business\r\nand is performing extremely well as our customers\r\nrealize the benefits of our combined offering to help\r\nthem bring new drugs and therapies to patients\r\nWe are winning significant new business in clinical\r\nresearch services and have raised our revenue\r\nsynergy expectations for the business\r\nGiven the strong growth outlook during the year we\r\nopened a new stateoftheart bioanalytical lab at our\r\nclinical research campus in Richmond Virginia to\r\nsupport increasing demand for analytical services to\r\naccelerate drug development\r\nAs always our Practical Process Improvement\r\nPPI

company and demonstrated how we\u2019ll remain one in the years to come Our response and performance have been true to both our legacy of achievement and our commitment to the future As we emerge from the pandemic we are ready to lead in the dynamic new era of healthcare that lies ahead CHALLENGE AND OPPORTUNITY\r\nWith its breadth and impact on all aspects of society\r\nCovid has been the most significant global health crisis in\r\na century When the world needed help as this new virus\r\nground it to a halt Abbott answered the call We quickly\r\nformed a battery of RD and operational teams to attack\r\nthe new virus from multiple angles\r\nThe result more than a dozen different tests for use at all\r\nstages of the disease process and in a wide range of testing\r\nstyles and environments from hospital laboratories to\r\nselftesting\r\nThe availability of fast accurate and accessible testing\r\nwas a major factor in the world\u2019s response to the\r\npandemic It gave people confidence that they could\r\nconduct their lives safely and allowed them to regain\r\nnormalcy after the disruptions of the virus\r\nThe success of our actions also built major new businesses\r\nfor Abbott at unprecedented speed and importantly for\r\nthe long term demonstrated the power and potential of\r\nrapid diagnostics We showed the world the many benefits\r\nof testing \u2014 and of health technology broadly \u2014 that is\r\ndecentralized digitized and democratized This greatly\r\naccelerated the adoption of the technology and built\r\nstrong new channels to pharmacies to doctors\u2019 offices\r\nand to people\u2019s homes\r\nSo while Covid testing will become a smaller part of\r\nour business as we move from a pandemic to an endemic\r\nlevel Abbott has built a leading position for the promising\r\nfuture of rapid testing\r\nAnd this is not the only longterm opportunity that the\r\nsuccess of our pandemic response made possible for us\r\nOver this period our Covidtesting revenues allowed us to\r\ninvest an additional 2 billion to fund or accelerate RD\r\nprograms and marketing efforts in our priority growth\r\nareas We also invested approximately 6 billion in capital\r\nprojects that will expand our manufacturing capacity and\r\nimprove our capabilities\r\nAs a result of these strategic moves and investments\r\nAbbott is an even stronger company coming out of Covid\r\nthan we were going into it\r\nThe pandemic has of course had many other impacts on\r\nour operating environment and our business It\u2019s affected\r\nour institutional customers by reducing their ability to\r\nperform hospital procedures and routine testing And it\u2019s\r\ndisrupted global supply chains and work patterns both of\r\nwhich have contributed to inflation\r\nAbbott has dealt with challenges like these time and again\r\nover its long history While Covid whipped them together\r\ninto a unique storm we\u2019ve weathered many Abbott is a\r\nlongterm company we know how to plan how to adapt\r\nhow to find the ways we need to deliver for both our\r\ncustomers and our shareholders\r\nThat\u2019s how over the three years of the pandemic we\r\nnot only returned a total of nearly 15 billion to\r\nshareholders through dividends and share repurchases\r\nbut at the same time continued to invest for our durable\r\nlongterm growth\r\nSignificant as today\u2019s challenges are you can rely on\r\nAbbott to persevere to perform and to live up to our\r\nvalues as we always have\r\nAn example was our voluntary recall of infant formula\r\nand temporary suspension of manufacturing at one of our US plants We addressed this situation and resumed\r\nproduction in July With adjustments to our global\r\nmanufacturing network \u2014 running our US facilities\r\nat increased capacity and importing additional formula\r\nfrom Europe \u2014 we were able to deliver roughly the same\r\nvolume of formula in the US in the second half of 2022\r\nas we did prior to the stoppage As a result availability on\r\nstore shelves is improving and we will continue working\r\nto get families the consistent and dependable supply of\r\nhighquality infant formula they\u2019ve relied on for almost\r\na century\r\nWhile managing the demands of the present we\u2019ve kept\r\nour eyes on the future and its opportunities which we\r\nbelieve have never been greater\r\nMedical science is advancing at high speed with\r\nsignificant progress in miniaturization and greater\r\nunderstanding of gene expression and the microbiome\r\nData technology is doing the same with new capabilities\r\nfrom artificial intelligence to machine learning to\r\nadvanced manufacturing And the two fields are\r\ncombining to create remarkable new possibilities\r\nNew connected technologies allow patients to receive\r\ncare from their physicians whenever and wherever they\r\nneed it Wearable digital sensing technologies give people\r\nthe information about their bodies that they need to\r\nmanage medical conditions or monitor and improve their\r\nhealth New diagnostic platforms are transforming the\r\nways testing is conducted from the lab to the home We\u2019re\r\nin the midst of a new healthcare revolution and Abbott is\r\namong its foremost leaders\r\nIn 2022 alone we delivered a host of innovative new\r\nproduct approvals and launches including\r\n\u2022 FreeStyle Libre 3 the world\u2019s smallest most accurate\r\ncontinuous glucose monitoring sensor\r\n\u2022 The EnSite X EP System our new cardiac mapping\r\nplatform which helps physicians better treat abnormal\r\nheart rhythms\r\n\u2022 Aveir our singlechamber leadless pacemaker for the\r\ntreatment of patients with slow heart rhythms\r\n\u2022 An upgraded version of our NeuroSphere myPath digital\r\nhealth app with enhanced functionality\r\n\u2022 Our Proclaim Plus spinal cord stimulation system\r\nfeaturing the next generation of Abbott\u2019s proprietary\r\nBurstDR therapy\r\n\u2022 And two new Amplatzer cardiac devices Amulet which\r\nhelps reduce the risk of stroke in people with atrial\r\nfibrillation and Talisman to treat people with a small\r\nopening between the upper chambers of the heart that\r\nputs them at risk of recurrent ischemic stroke\r\nAnd our pipeline for the future remains very rich\r\nWe have the technologies and opportunities we need\r\nto fuel both therapeutic advancement and robust\r\ngrowth for years to come These technologies and\r\ntheir lifechanging impact for patients and consumers\r\ncan be seen throughout this report\r\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\r\nDespite the headwinds in our operating environment\r\nAbbott delivered sales of 437 billion in 2022 \u2014 an\r\nincrease of around 64 percent on an organic basis2\r\n \u2014\r\nand earningspershare of 5343\r\n exceeding our initial\r\nforecast for the year In December we announced a dividend increase of\r\n85 percent for 2023 this makes for an average annual\r\ndividend increase of more than 12 percent since the\r\nbeginning of the pandemic Abbott has now paid\r\ndividends for 99 consecutive years and is in the exclusive\r\nranks of Dividend Kings the small group of companies\r\nthat have increased dividends for more than 50 years\r\nin a row\r\nOver the past three years Abbott has provided\r\nshareholders a total return of approximately 325\r\npercent versus a market return of 236 percent\r\nThe key to that success in an environment like today\u2019s is\r\nour diversified business strategy which gives us defensive\r\nstrength by protecting us from market downturns in\r\nparticular businesses and offensive strength by providing\r\nus more ways to compete and win\r\nTHE FUTURE\r\nThe challenges of the last three years demonstrate\r\nprecisely why and how Abbott will continue to lead far\r\ninto the future Our company has thrived for 135 years\r\nbecause of its resilience and adaptability its diversified\r\nportfolio of leading businesses its financial strength\r\nand acumen and a deeprooted culture of service\r\nexecution and success\r\nBecause of our extensive history and experience Abbott\r\ntakes the long view While our experience helps us\r\nnavigate the waters of the present it also ensures that we\r\nalways steer toward the horizon We\u2019re inspired by the\r\nimmense potential of the future of healthcare and believe\r\nthat we are very well positioned to capture it\r\nOur objective laid out in our 2030 Sustainability Plan\r\nis to help three billion people every year with Abbott\r\nproducts \u2014 a fifty percent increase over the course of the\r\nplan To achieve that ambitious goal we\u2019re working to\r\ntransform the future of healthcare We\u2019ve adopted a set of\r\nguiding innovation principles with the explicit intention\r\nof making our technologies more accessible to more\r\npeople That means easier to use It means deliverable in\r\nnew ways And it means reducing the total cost of care to\r\nhelp patients providers and payers\r\nWe\u2019re energized by that vision and believe there\u2019s never\r\nbeen a better time to be in healthcare We\u2019re here at\r\nAbbott to help people live fuller lives through better\r\nhealth That\u2019s a high purpose and a responsibility that\r\nwe take very seriously To us it

to\r\ncollect packaging for recycling through our World Without\r\nWaste initiative We also partner to design new solutions for\r\npackaging For example we licensed our technology for a 100\r\nplantbased plastic bottle to a company building a commercialscale facility in Germany This biobased plastic packaging\r\nhas a lower carbon footprint than other plastics While we\u2019re\r\nmaking progress we know there is more work to be done\r\nIn 2022 we collected 61 of the equivalent bottles and cans\r\nthat we introduced into the market and used 15 rPET\r\nin our bottles\r\nTo galvanize collective action we invest in solutions and\r\npartnerships across industry governments and society\r\nIn 2022 we became a Strategic Partner of the Ellen MacArthur\r\nFoundation This group includes companies within key industry\r\nsectors that can help drive the transition to a circular economy\r\nClimate Our water packaging and climate goals are\r\ninterconnected For example by creating a circular economy\r\nfor packaging we can lower our carbon footprint\r\nBy approaching water stewardship from a basin perspective\r\nwe participate in initiatives that increase communities\u2019\r\nresilience to extreme weather events alongside our partners\r\nOur approach to climate is rooted in science and we\u2019ve\r\nset a sciencebased target
