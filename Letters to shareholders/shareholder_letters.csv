1,Walmart,General Merchandisers,"2,100,000",611289,397475,11680,1.9,WMT,"Dear Shareholders and Associates, Thank you. Gratitude is the first, last and most important thing that I’d like to convey with this letter. To our shareholders, we appreciate your confidence in our company. Many of you have held our shares for a long time and that means the world to us. To our associates, you did such a great job navigating a challenging year. Fiscal year 2023 brought new surprises and challenges, and as I visited with many of you in our stores, clubs, distribution, and fulfillment centers, you handled everything with such a positive attitude. We’re impressed and grateful. I’ve been with our company for more than 32 years. I’ve seen us evolve from being a business that sold mostly general merchandise in the U.S., to creating the most successful store format in retail called the Supercenter, to now being the leading omnichannel retailer in the world. I’m excited about what we’ll do next. Around the world, we have great people and a powerful set of assets and capabilities. With our combination of stores, Sam’s Clubs, and eCommerce capabilities, we’re positioned to serve people however they want to shop. They can come see us in a store or club or use their mobile device to order from an increasingly broad assortment. They can save money and time with us however they choose to in that moment. Our ability to serve people how they want to be served has enabled us to add $156 billion in revenue in the last five years and $125 billion in the last three years, reflecting a compounded annual growth rate of 6 percent and 8 percent, respectively. Our results from last year included sales growth of 9 percent in our retained markets outside the U.S., and comp sales of 10.5 percent in Sam’s Club U.S. and 6.6 percent in Walmart U.S. That reflects double-digit comps at Sam’s Club U.S. for the third- consecutive year, record membership counts, and a growing popularity with Gen Z members. Globally, our eCommerce sales have reached $82 billion and now make up 14 percent of our total sales. We ended the year with inventory in good shape despite the challenges earlier in the year. I’ve been asked lately, “How do you describe the company today given how much we’ve changed?” We describe today’s Walmart as a people-led, tech-powered omnichannel retailer dedicated to helping people save money and live better. We work to bring the purpose Sam Walton described in 1992 to life for those we have the privilege to serve. We know who we are. We like who we are. And we like who we’re becoming. I wouldn’t trade what we have with anyone. Let’s break down the description of today’s Walmart. I’ll start with our people because it’s our 2.1 million associates that make the difference. They make it all happen. Our job is to create opportunities for them to fulfill their potential and to make sure every one of them feels like they belong at Walmart. We provide a ladder of opportunity. We’re constantly changing to create the right level of investments in wages and benefits, including healthcare, opportunities to save through a 401k, our Walmart stock ownership plan, and our investments in educational opportunities with our own academies and Live Better U. In the U.S., about 75 percent of salaried store, club, and supply chain managers started their careers as hourly associates. Healthcare coverage for a U.S. associate starts at $33 per pay period. We provide up to $20,000 in support for adoption or surrogacy, and a birth mom can receive up to 22 weeks of paid leave. In addition to our own internal academies, Live Better U lets associates choose from 75 programs across 25 education providers where they can develop skills in areas like business management and data analytics. We’ve seen 105,000 associates use these programs since 2018, and we estimate they’ve saved about $333 million in tuition costs. More than ever, we’re being powered by technology. Our customers and members engage through our apps and sites, and our associates have information and capabilities at their fingertips. We’re learning to put our data to work. We’ve modernized our tech stack, and we’re building and scaling new applications like a virtual fitting room and Scan & Go. We’ve built a conversational AI platform enabling voice and chat capabilities that’s being used by more than 50 million customers across many of our markets. Our associates used our Ask Sam application to answer 1.3 billion questions last year to help them do things like find an item, check a modular, or see who is working in a particular area that day. When we bring our people and our tech together to serve customers and members, we create a true omnichannel experience. There isn’t another retailer with over 10,500 stores, Sam’s Clubs, and a scaled eCommerce business. For the first time I know of, our reputation for convenience has risen to nearly the same level as our strong reputation for price. This is an exciting development. During a recent investor conference, we shared our focus on growth as well as improved operating margin and return on investment. We can deliver value with everyday low prices for customers and members and improve our profitability and returns through productivity improvements and a new mix of businesses, including a growing marketplace and advertising. We’re dedicated to helping people save money and live better. Everyone understands what we mean when we say save money, but what does it mean to help people live better? This part of our strategy includes saving people time, helping them improve their health, providing tools to save on financial transactions, and strengthening their communities, and the planet. We have an aspiration to become a regenerative company. Being regenerative means restoring, renewing, and replenishing. Based on our latest estimates, we are now diverting 78 percent of our waste from landfills, and 46 percent of our energy is provided by renewables. And we’re now three-quarters of the way toward our Project Gigaton goal to reduce or avoid one billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Incredible. A huge thank you to our merchants and our participating suppliers! It’s an exciting time to be at Walmart. We’re at an important strategic and financial inflection point. Our strategy is simple. It’s to bring our purpose to life. The business we’re building positions us to earn trust and build an even stronger relationship with our customers and members. Thank you for the role you play. With Gratitude,",
2,Amazon.com,Internet Services and Retailing,"1,541,000",513983,1058440,-2722,-0.5,AMZN,"Dear shareholders: As I sit down to write my second annual shareholder letter as CEO, I find myself optimistic and energized bywhatlies aheadforAmazon.Despite2022beingoneof thehardermacroeconomicyearsinrecentmemory, and with some of our own operating challenges to boot, we still found a way to grow demand (on top of the unprecedented growth we experienced in the first half of the pandemic). We innovated in our largest businesses to meaningfully improve customer experience short and long term. And, we made important adjustments in our investment decisions and the way in which we’ll invent moving forward, while still preserving the long-term investments that we believe can change the future of Amazon for customers, shareholders, and employees. While there were an unusual number of simultaneous challenges this past year, the reality is that if you operate in large, dynamic, global market segments with many capable and well-funded competitors (the conditions in which Amazon operates all of its businesses), conditions rarely stay stagnant for long. In the 25years I’ve been at Amazon, there has been constant change, much of whichwe’ve initiated ourselves. WhenIjoined Amazon in 1997, we had booked $15M in revenue in 1996, were a books-only retailer, did not haveathird-party marketplace, andonlyshippedtoaddressesintheUS.Today,Amazonsellsnearlyevery physical and digital retail item you can imagine, with a vibrant third-party seller ecosystem that accounts for 60% of our unit sales, and reaches customers in virtually every country around the world. Similarly, building a business around a set of technology infrastructure services in the cloud was not obvious in 2003 when westarted pursuing AWS, and still wasn’t when we launched our first services in 2006. Having virtually every book at your fingertips in 60 seconds, and then being able to store and retrieve them on a lightweight digital reader was not“athing”yetwhenwelaunchedKindlein2007,norwasavoice-drivenpersonalassistant like Alexa (launched in 2014) that you could use to access entertainment, control your smart home, shop, and retrieve all sorts of information. There have also been times when macroeconomic conditions or operating inefficiencies have presented us with new challenges. For instance, in the 2001 dot-com crash, we had to secure letters of credit to buy inventory for the holidays, streamline costs to deliver better profitability for the business, yet still prioritized the long-term customer experience and business we were trying to build (if you remember, we actually lowered prices in most of our categories during that tenuous 2001 period). You saw this sort of balancing again in 2008-2009 as we endured the recession provoked by the mortgage-backed securities financial crisis. Wetook several actions to manage the cost structure and efficiency of our Stores business, but we also balanced this streamlining with investment in customer experiences that we believed could be substantial future businesses with strong returns for shareholders. In 2008, AWS was still a fairly small, fledgling business. Weknewwewere onto something, but it still required substantial capital investment. There were voices inside and outside of the company questioning why Amazon (known mostly as an online retailer then) would be investing so much in cloud computing. But, we knew we were inventing something special that could create a lot of value for customers and Amazon in the future. We had a head start on potential competitors; and if anything, we wanted to accelerate our pace of innovation. We made the long-term decision to continue investing in AWS. Fifteen years later, AWS is now an $85B annual revenue run rate business, with strong profitability, that has transformed how customers from start-ups to multinational companies to public sector organizations manage their technology infrastructure. Amazon would be a different company if we’d slowed investment in AWS during that 2008-2009 period. Change is always around the corner. Sometimes, you proactively invite it in, and sometimes it just comes a-knocking. But, when you see it’s coming, you have to embrace it. And, the companies that do this well over a long period of time usually succeed. I’m optimistic about our future prospects because I like the way our team is responding to the changes we see in front of us. Over the last several months, we took a deep look across the company, business by business, invention by invention, and asked ourselves whether we had conviction about each initiative’s long-term potential to drive enough revenue, operating income, free cash flow, and return on invested capital. In some cases, it led to us shuttering certain businesses. For instance, we stopped pursuing physical store concepts like our Bookstores and 4 Star stores, closed our Amazon Fabric and Amazon Care efforts, and moved on from some newer devices where we didn’t see a path to meaningful returns. In other cases, we looked at some programs that weren’t producing the returns we’d hoped (e.g. free shipping for all online grocery orders over $35) and amended them. We also reprioritized where to spend our resources, which ultimately led to the hard decision to eliminate 27,000 corporate roles. There are a number of other changes that we’ve made over the last several months to streamline our overall costs, and like most leadership teams, we’ll continue to evaluate what we’re seeing in our business and proceed adaptively. Wealso looked hard at how we were working together as a team and asked our corporate employees to come back to the office at least three days a week, beginning in May. During the pandemic, our employees rallied to get work done from home and did everything possible to keep up with the unexpected circumstances that presented themselves. It was impressive and I’m proud of the way our collective team came together to overcome unprecedented challenges for our customers, communities, and business. But, we don’t think it’s the best long-term approach. We’ve become convinced that collaborating and inventing is easier and more effective when we’re working together and learning from one another in person. The energy and riffing on oneanother’s ideas happenmorefreely,andmanyof thebestAmazoninventionshavehadtheirbreakthrough moments from people staying behind after a meeting and working through ideas on a whiteboard, or continuing the conversation on the walk back from a meeting, or just popping by a teammate’s office later that day with another thought. Invention is often messy. It wanders and meanders and marinates. Serendipitous interactions help it, and there are more of those in-person than virtually. It’s also significantly easier to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture when we’re in the office together most of the time and surrounded by our colleagues. Innovation and our unique culture have been incredibly important in our first 29 years as a company, and I expect it will be comparably so in the next 29. Acritical challenge we’ve continued to tackle is the rising cost to serve in our Stores fulfillment network (i.e. the cost to get a product from Amazon to a customer)—and we’ve made several changes that we believe will meaningfully improve our fulfillment costs and speed of delivery. During the early part of the pandemic, with many physical stores shut down, our consumer business grew at anextraordinary clip, with annual revenue increasing from $245B in 2019to$434Bin2022.Thismeantthat we had to double the fulfillment center footprint that we’d built over the prior 25 years and substantially accelerate building a last-mile transportation network that’s now the size of UPS (along with a new sortation center network to assist with efficiency and speed when items needed to traverse long distances)—all in the span of about twoyears. This was no easy feat, and hundreds of thousands of Amazonians worked very hard to make this happen. However, not surprisingly, with that rate and scale of change, there was a lot of optimization needed to yield the intended productivity. Over the last several months, we’ve scrutinized every process path in our fulfillment centers and transportation network and redesigned scores of processes and mechanisms, resulting in steady productivity gains and cost reductions over the last few quarters. There’s more work to do, but we’re pleased with our trajectory and the meaningful upside in front of us. Wealso took this occasion to make larger structural changes that set us up better to deliver lower costs and faster speed for many years to come. A good example was reevaluating how our US fulfillment network was organized. Until recently, Amazon operated one national US fulfillment network that distributed inventory from fulfillment centers spread across the entire country. If a local fulfillment center didn’t have the product a customer ordered, we’d end up shipping it from other parts of the country, costing us more and increasing delivery times. This challenge became more pronounced as our fulfillment network expanded to hundreds of additional nodes over the last few years, distributing inventory across more locations and increasing the complexity of connecting the fulfillment center and delivery station nodes efficiently. Last year, we started rearchitecting our inventory placement strategy and leveraging our larger fulfillment center footprint to move from a national fulfillment network to a regionalized network model. We made significant internal changes (e.g. placement and logistics software, processes, physical operations) to create eight interconnected regions in smaller geographic areas. Each of these regions has broad, relevant selection to operate in a largely self sufficient way, while still being able to ship nationally when necessary. Some of the most meaningful and hard work came from optimizing the connections between this large amount of infrastructure. We also continue to improveouradvancedmachinelearningalgorithmstobetterpredict whatcustomersinvariousparts of the country will need so that we have the right inventory in the right regions at the right time. We’ve recently completed this regional roll out and like the early results. Shorter travel distances mean lower cost to serve, less impact on the environment, and customers getting their orders faster. On the latter, we’re excited about seeing more next day and same-day deliveries, and we’re on track to have our fastest Prime delivery speeds ever in 2023. Overall, we remain confident about our plans to lower costs, reduce delivery times, and build a meaningfully larger retail business with healthy operating margins. AWShasan$85Bannualized revenue run rate, is still early in its adoption curve, but at a juncture where it’s critical to stay focused on what matters most to customers over the long-haul. Despite growing 29% year-over year (“YoY”) in 2022 on a $62B revenue base, AWS faces short-term headwinds right now as companies are being more cautious in spending given the challenging, current macroeconomic conditions. While some companies might obsess over howtheycouldextract as muchmoneyfromcustomersaspossibleinthese tight times, it’s neither what customers want nor best for customers in the long term, so we’re taking a different tack. One of the many advantages of AWS and cloud computing is that when your business grows, you can seamlessly scale up; and conversely, if your business contracts, you can choose to give us back that capacity and cease paying for it. This elasticity is unique to the cloud, and doesn’t exist when you’ve already made expensive capital investments in your own on-premises datacenters, servers, and networking gear. In AWS, like all our businesses, we’re not trying to optimize for any one quarter or year. We’re trying to build customer relationships (and a business) that outlast all of us; and as a result, our AWS sales and support teams are spending much of their time helping customers optimize their AWS spend so they can better weather this uncertain economy. Many of these AWS customers tell us that they’re not cost-cutting as much as cost optimizing so they can take their resources and apply them to emerging and inventive new customer experiences they’re planning. Customers have appreciated this customer-focused, long-term approach, and we think it’ll bode well for both customers and AWS. While these short-term headwinds soften our growth rate, we like a lot of the fundamentals that we’re seeing in AWS. Our new customer pipeline is robust, as are our active migrations. Many companies use discontinuous periods like this to step back and determine what they strategically want to change, and we find an increasing number of enterprises opting out of managing their own infrastructure, and preferring to move to AWStoenjoy the agility, innovation, cost-efficiency, and security benefits. And most importantly for customers, AWScontinuestodelivernewcapabilitiesrapidly(over3,300newfeaturesandserviceslaunched in 2022), and invest in long-term inventions that change what’s possible. Chip development is a good example. In last year’s letter, I mentioned the investment we were making in our general-purpose CPU processors named Graviton. Graviton2-based compute instances deliver up to 40% better price-performance than thecomparablelatestgenerationx86-basedinstances; andin2022,wedelivered our Graviton3 chips, providing 25% better performance than the Graviton2 processors. Further, as machine learning adoption has continued to accelerate, customers have yearned for lower-cost GPUs (the chips most commonly used for machine learning). AWS started investing years ago in these specialized chips for machine learning training and inference (inferences are the predictions or answers that a machine learning model provides). We delivered our first training chip in 2022 (“Trainium”); and for the most common machine learning models, Trainium-based instances are up to 140% faster than GPU-based instances at up to 70%lower cost. Most companies are still in the training stage, but as they develop models that graduate to large-scale production, they’ll find that most of the cost is in inference because models are trained periodically whereas inferences are happening all the time as their associated application is being exercised. Welaunchedourfirstinference chips (“Inferentia”) in 2019, and they have saved companies like Amazonover a hundred million dollars in capital expense already. Our Inferentia2 chip, which just launched, offers up to four times higher throughput and ten times lower latency than our first Inferentia processor. With the enormous upcoming growth in machine learning, customers will be able to get a lot more done with AWS’s training and inference chips at a significantly lower cost. We’re not close to being done innovating here, and this long-term investment should prove fruitful for both customers and AWS. AWS is still in the early stages of its evolution, and has a chance for unusual growth in the next decade. Similarly high potential, Amazon’s Advertising business is uniquely effective for brands, which is part of why it continues to grow at a brisk clip. Akin to physical retailers’ advertising businesses selling shelf space, end caps, and placement in their circulars, our sponsored products and brands offerings have been an integral part of the Amazon shopping experience for more than a decade. However, unlike physical retailers, Amazon can tailor these sponsored products to be relevant to what customers are searching for given what we know about shopping behaviors and our very deep investment in machine learning algorithms. This leads to advertising that’s more useful for customers; and as a result, performs better for brands. This is part of why our Advertising revenue has continued to grow rapidly (23% YoY in Q4 2022, 25% YoY overall for 2022 on a $31B revenue base), even as most large advertising-focused businesses’ growth have slowed over the last several quarters. Westrive to be the best place for advertisers to build their brands. We have near and long-term opportunities that will help us achieve that mission. We’re continuing to make large investments in machine learning to keep honing our advertising selection algorithms. For the past couple of years, we’ve invested in building comprehensive, flexible, and durable planning and measurement solutions, giving marketers greater insight into advertising effectiveness. An example is Amazon Marketing Cloud (“AMC”). AMC is a “clean room” (i.e. secure digital environment) in which advertisers can run custom audience and campaign analytics across a range of first and third-party inputs, in a privacy-safe manner, to generate advertising and business insights to inform their broader marketing and sales strategies. The Advertising and AWS teams have collaborated to enable companies to store their data in AWS, operate securely in AMC with Amazon and other third-party data sources, perform analytics in AWS, and have the option to activate advertising on Amazon or third-party publishers through the Amazon Demand-Side Platform. Customers really like this concerted capability. We also see future opportunity to thoughtfully integrate advertising into our video, live sports, audio, and grocery products. We’ll continue to work hard to help brands uniquely engage with the right audience, and grow this part of our business. While it’s tempting in turbulent times only to focus on your existing large businesses, to build a sustainable, long-lasting, growing company that helps customers across a large number of dimensions, you can’t stop inventing and working on long-term customer experiences that can meaningfully impact customers and your company. Whenwelook at new investment opportunities, we ask ourselves a few questions: ◦ If wewere successful, could it be big and have a reasonable return on invested capital? ◦ Is the opportunity being well-served today? ◦ Dowehaveadifferentiated approach? ◦ And,dowehave competence in that area? And if not, can we acquire it quickly? If we like the answers to those questions, then we’ll invest. This process has led to some expansions that seem straightforward, and others that some folks might not have initially guessed. The earliest example is when we chose to expand from just selling Books, to adding categories like Music, Video, Electronics, and Toys. Back then (1998-1999), it wasn’t universally applauded, but in retrospect, it seems fairly obvious. The same could be said for our international Stores expansion. In 2022, our international consumer segment drove $118B of revenue. In our larger, established international consumer businesses, we’re big enough to be impacted by the slowing macroeconomic conditions; however, the growth in 2019-2021 on a large base was remarkable—30% compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) in the UK, 26% in Germany, and 21% in Japan (excluding the impact of FX). Over the past several years, we’ve invested in new international geographies, including India, Brazil, Mexico, Australia, various European countries, the Middle East, and parts of Africa. These new countries take a certain amount of fixed investment to get started and to scale, but we like the trajectory they’re on, and their growth patterns resemble what we’ve seen in North America and our established international geographies. Emerging countries sometimes lack some of the infrastructure and services that our business relies on (e.g. payment methods, transportation services, and internet/ telecom infrastructure). To solve these challenges, we continue to work with various partners to deliver solutions for customers. Ultimately, we believe that this investment in serving a broader geographical footprint will allow us to help more customers across the world, as well as build a larger free cash flow-generating consumer business. Beyond geographic expansion, we’ve been working to expand our customer offerings across some large, unique product retail market segments. Grocery is an $800B market segment in the US alone, with the average household shopping three to four times per week. Amazon has built a somewhat unusual, but significant grocery business over nearly 20 years. Similar to how other mass merchants entered the grocery space in the 1980s, we began by adding products typically found in supermarket aisles that don’t require temperature control such as paper products, canned and boxed food, candy and snacks, pet care, health and personal care, and beauty. However, we offer more than three million items compared to a typical supermarket’s 30K for the same categories. To date, we’ve also focused on larger pack sizes, given the current cost to serve online delivery. While we’re pleased with the size and growth of our grocery business, we aspire to serve more of our customers’grocery needs than wedotoday.Todoso,weneedabroaderphysicalstorefootprintgiventhat most of the grocery shopping still happens in physical venues. Whole Foods Market pioneered the natural andorganicspecialty grocerystore concept40yearsago.Today,it’salargeandgrowingbusinessthatcontinues to raise the bar for healthy and sustainable food. Over the past year, we’ve continued to invest in the business while also making changes to drive better profitability. Whole Foods is on an encouraging path, but to have a larger impact on physical grocery, we must find a mass grocery format that we believe is worth expanding broadly. Amazon Fresh is the brand we’ve been experimenting with for a few years, and we’re working hard to identify and build the right mass grocery format for Amazon scale. Grocery is a big growth opportunity for Amazon. Amazon Business is another example of an investment where our ecommerce and logistics capabilities position us well to pursue this large market segment. Amazon Business allows businesses, municipalities, and organizations to procure products like office supplies and other bulk items easily and at great savings. While someareas of the economyhavestruggled over the past few years, Amazon Business has thrived. Why? Because the team has translated what it means to deliver selection, value, and convenience into a business procurement setting, constantly listening to and learning from customers, and innovating on their behalf. Some people have never heard of Amazon Business, but, our business customers love it. Amazon Business launched in 2015 and today drives roughly $35B in annualized gross sales. More than six million active customers, including 96 of the global Fortune 100 companies, are enjoying Amazon Business’ one-stop shopping, real-time analytics, and broad selection on hundreds of millions of business supplies. We believe that we’ve only scratched the surface of what’s possible to date, and plan to keep building the features our business customers tell us they need and want. While many brands and merchants successfully sell their products on Amazon’s marketplace, there are also a large number of brands and sellers who have launched their own direct-to-consumer websites. One of the challenges for these merchants is driving conversion from views to purchases. We invented Buy with Prime to help with this challenge. Buy with Prime allows third-party brands and sellers to offer their products on their ownwebsitestoourlargeAmazonPrimemembership,andofferthosecustomersfast,freePrimeshipping and seamless checkout with their Amazon account. Buy with Prime provides merchants several additional benefits, including Amazon handling the product storage, picking, packing, delivery, payment, and any returns, all through Amazon Pay and Fulfillment by Amazon. Buy with Prime has recently been made available to all US merchants; and so far, Buy with Prime has increased shopper conversion on third-party shopping sites by 25% on average. Merchants are excited about converting more sales and fulfilling these shipments more easily, Prime members love that they can use their Prime benefits on more destinations, and Buy with Prime allows us to improve the shopping experience across more of the web. Expanding internationally, pursuing large retail market segments that are still nascent for Amazon, and using our unique assets to help merchants sell more effectively on their own websites are somewhat natural extensions for us. There are also a few investments we’re making that are further from our core businesses, but where we see unique opportunity. In 2003, AWS would have been a classic example. In 2023, Amazon Healthcare and Kuiper are potential analogues. Ourinitial efforts in Healthcare began with pharmacy, which felt less like a major departure from ecommerce. For years, Amazon customers had asked us when we’d offer them an online pharmacy as their frustrations mountedwithcurrentproviders. Launched in 2020, AmazonPharmacyisafull-service, online pharmacythat offers transparent pricing, easy refills, and savings for Prime members. The business is growing quickly, and continues to innovate. An example is Amazon Pharmacy’s recent launch of RxPass, which for a $5 per month flat fee, enables Prime members to get as many of the eligible prescription medications as they need for dozens of common conditions, like high blood pressure, acid reflux, and anxiety. However, our customers have continued to express a strong desire for Amazon to provide a better alternative to the inefficient and unsatisfying broader healthcare experience. We decided to start with primary care as it’s a prevalent first stop in the patient journey. We evaluated and studied the existing landscape extensively, including some early Amazon experiments like Amazon Care. During this process, we identified One Medical’s patient-focused experience as anexcellent foundation uponwhichtobuildourfuturebusiness;andinJuly2022,weannounced our acquisition of One Medical. There are several elements that customers love about One Medical. It has a fantastic digital app that makes it easy for patients to discuss issues with a medical practitioner via chat or video conference. If a physical visit is required, One Medical has offices in cities across the US where patients can book same or next day appointments. One Medical has relationships with specialty physicians in each of its cities and works closely with local hospital systems to make seeing specialists easy, so One Medical members can quickly access these resources when needed. Going forward, we strongly believe that One Medical and Amazon will continue to innovate together to change what primary care will look like for customers. Kuiper is another example of Amazon innovating for customers over the long term in an area where there’s high customerneed.OurvisionforKuiperistocreatealow-Earthorbitsatellite system to deliver high-quality broadband internet service to places around the world that don’t currently have it. There are hundreds of millions of households and businesses who don’t have reliable access to the internet. Imagine what they’ll be able to do with reliable connectivity, from people taking online education courses, using financial services, starting their own businesses, doing their shopping, enjoying entertainment, to businesses and governments improving their coverage, efficiency, and operations. Kuiper will deliver not only accessibility, but affordability. Our teams have developed low-cost antennas (i.e. customer terminals) that will lower the barriers to access. We recently unveiled the new terminals that will communicate with the satellites passing overhead, andweexpecttobeabletoproduceourstandardresidentialversionforlessthan$400each.They’re small: 11 inches square, 1 inch thick, and weigh less than 5 pounds without their mounting bracket, but they deliver speeds up to 400 megabits per second. Andthey’re poweredbyAmazon-designedbasebandchips. We’re preparing to launch two prototype satellites to test the entire end-to-end communications network this year, and plan to be in beta with commercial customers in 2024. The customer reaction to what we’ve shared thus far about Kuiper has been very positive, and we believe Kuiper represents a very large potential opportunity for Amazon. It also shares several similarities to AWS in that it’s capital intensive at the start, but has a large prospective consumer, enterprise, and government customer base, significant revenue and operating profit potential, and relatively few companies with the technical and inventive aptitude, as well as the investment hypothesis to go after it. One final investment area that I’ll mention, that’s core to setting Amazon up to invent in every area of our business for many decades to come, and where we’re investing heavily is Large Language Models (“LLMs”) and Generative AI. Machine learning has been a technology with high promise for several decades, but it’s only been the last five to ten years that it’s started to be used more pervasively by companies. This shift was driven byseveral factors, including access to higher volumes of computecapacity at lowerprices thanwasever available. Amazon has been using machine learning extensively for 25 years, employing it in everything from personalized ecommerce recommendations, to fulfillment center pick paths, to drones for Prime Air, to Alexa, to the many machine learning services AWS offers (where AWS has the broadest machine learning functionality and customer base of any cloud provider). More recently, a newer form of machine learning, called Generative AI, has burst onto the scene and promises to significantly accelerate machine learning adoption. Generative AI is based on very Large Language Models (trained on up to hundreds of billions of parameters, and growing), across expansive datasets, and has radically general and broad recall and learning capabilities. We have been working on our own LLMs for a while now, believe it will transform and improve virtually every customer experience, and will continue to invest substantially in these models across all of our consumer, seller, brand, and creator experiences. Additionally, as we’ve done for years in AWS, we’re democratizing this technology so companies of all sizes can leverage Generative AI. AWS is offering the most price-performant machine learning chips in Trainium and Inferentia so small and large companies can afford to train and run their LLMs in production. We enable companies to choose from various LLMs and build applications with all of the AWS security, privacy and other features that customers are accustomedtousing.And,we’redelivering applications like AWS’s CodeWhisperer, which revolutionizes developer productivity by generating code suggestions in real time. I could write an entire letter on LLMs and Generative AI as I think they will be that transformative, but I’ll leave that for a future letter. Let’s just say that LLMs and Generative AI are going to be a big deal for customers, our shareholders, and Amazon. So, in closing, I’m optimistic that we’ll emerge from this challenging macroeconomic time in a stronger position than when we entered it. There are several reasons for it and I’ve mentioned many of them above. But, there are two relatively simple statistics that underline our immense future opportunity. While we have a consumer business that’s $434B in 2022, the vast majority of total market segment share in global retail still resides in physical stores (roughly 80%). And, it’s a similar story for Global IT spending, where we have AWSrevenue of $80B in 2022, with about 90% of Global IT spending still on-premises and yet to migrate to thecloud.Astheseequationssteadilyflip—aswe’realreadyseeinghappen—webelieveourleadingcustomer experiences, relentless invention, customer focus, and hard work will result in significant growth in the coming years.

Recognizing the vital role we play in this led us – in the face of deep economic uncertainty in 2020 and 2021 – to lean in when many retreated. We made the investments necessary to help meet the growth in global demand we knew would follow the COVID-related slowdown. As a result, we were positioned for success across all of our businesses in 2022. At the same time, we continued to focus on ways to meaningfully reduce our own and others’ greenhouse gas emissions. By evolving our operating model and consolidating into three core businesses – Upstream, Product Solutions, and Low Carbon Solutions – we leveraged our advantages of technology, scale, integration, and world-class employees to improve effectiveness, efficiency, and earnings resiliency. The positive impact of these changes is clearly seen in our results: Our North America refineries collectively delivered their best-ever annual throughput;8 we achieved record production in our Permian operations; and we significantly increased volumes in Guyana to help ease substantial shortages. In addition, we increased earnings to $56 billion, well ahead of our peers.1 We also increased planned investments in lower-emission initiatives to approximately $17 billion from 2022 through 2027 and made great strides to lower the emissions intensity of our operated assets. Low Carbon Solutions signed a first-of-its-kind agreement to capture, transport, and permanently store up to 2 million metric tons of third-party CO2 per year in Louisiana beginning in 2025. This would be the equivalent of replacing approximately 700,000 gasoline-powered cars with electric vehicles.9 This landmark event signaled to other potential customers that we are ready and uniquely able to help them meet their emission-reduction goals. In addition, in Baytown, Texas, we started up one of North America’s largest advanced recycling facilities, capable of processing more than 80 million pounds of plastic waste per year. our position as the industry leader in total shareholder returns,4 increasing the annual dividend for the 40th consecutive year, and returning approximately $30 billion to shareholders, equally balanced between dividends and share repurchases. The strength of our business and financial position have enabled up to $35 billion of cumulative share repurchases over the next two years. While our full-year 2022 results clearly benefited from a buoyant market, our strategy to invest counter-cyclically, combined with the hard work and commitment of our people, drove financial performance well above that of our competitors. We can help meet the world’s growing need for stable supplies of energy and essential products while also reducing our own and others’ emissions in support of a lower-emission future. For us, this is not an “either/ or” proposition. Rather, it’s an “and” equation. We can increase supply and reduce greenhouse gas emissions strengthening energy security and advancing a thoughtful energy transition. Thank you for investing in ExxonMobil and for your ongoing support. Our ability to significantly improve our cost structure and profitably grow our businesses helped improve earnings resiliency and fortify our balance sheet while increasing flexibility to navigate future down cycles.

Over the past year, teams across Apple came together in service of our timeless mission: creating technology that empowers people and enriches their lives. And the result was another record year — one defined by innovation, and by the bedrock values that have long defined our company.
There is a lot more to say about Apple’s year, and in that spirit, I’d like to invite you to join our 2023 Annual Meeting of Shareholders on Friday, March 10th. I hope you’ll join us.
The global challenges with us all today — from inflation, to war in Eastern Europe, to the enduring impacts of the pandemic — make this a time for deliberate and thoughtful action. But it is not a time to retreat from the future. We’ve always run Apple for the long-term, and that means continuing to invest in innovation, in people, and in the positive difference we can make in the world.
Today, we have the strongest lineup of products and services we’ve ever had, and our technology has never shown up for our users in more ways. And our latest innovations are helping so many of us harness our creativity, connect with loved ones, find entertainment and joy, and live safer, healthier lives.
Across this work, our values remain a driving force behind our innovations. And I’m so inspired by people across Apple working to make our technology even more accessible, more private, and more empowering for all who use it. That kind of teamwork is made possible by people with a diversity of ideas and backgrounds. And this year, we’ve continued to make important progress improving representation within Apple — while fostering a welcoming, inclusive culture where everyone belongs.
Our teams are also pressing forward in the fight against climate change. Our corporate operations have been carbon neutral for three years, and today, we’re working to become carbon neutral for our global supply chain and product use by 2030. We continue to bring new renewable energy online, protect forests that sequester carbon, and innovate to use more recycled and sustainable materials across our products.
Progress like this makes me profoundly confident about the future of Apple, and technology’s potential to solve problems and improve lives. And I remain grateful to everyone at Apple for the work they do each and every day — and to our shareholders for their trust and investment in our company.",

6,CVS Health,Health Care: Pharmacy and Other Services,"259,500",322467,95422,4149,1.3,CVS,"Dear Fellow Stockholders: 2022 marked a transformational year for CVS Health, with continued progress in advancing our strategy to become the leading health solutions company for consumers. Our management team and dedicated, purpose-driven workforce delivered excellent results, supporting our vision of delivering a superior health experience for consumers. Our 2022 Financial Performance In 2022 CVS Health delivered strong results across each of our foundational businesses as the Company surpassed $300 billion in total revenue and generated significant cash flow. This performance enabled us to return $6.4 billion to stockholders through dividend payments and common stock repurchases, while continuing to prioritize our balance sheet and remaining committed to investment grade ratings. This marks the first time we’ve executed stock repurchases since 2017 and also reflects a 10% increase in the dividend payment for 2022. We recently announced an additional 10% increase in the dividend payment that was effective in February 2023. Expanding Capabilities in Health Care Delivery CVS Health increasingly connects with consumers about their health in more places and on their terms, in the community, in the home and virtually. This omnichannel approach supports our ability to serve a broader customer and consumer base, especially those in underserved communities. We made significant progress on our strategic imperatives, which are to: • Grow our foundational businesses • Create new sources of value in care delivery and health services offerings • Enhance our omnichannel health capabilities and drive engagement • Deliver cutting edge tech to elevate customer and colleague experiences • Power a purpose-driven culture and consumer mindset Advancing value-based care is central to our strategy to deliver industry leading health care experiences for consumers and providers through a risk-enabled, vertically aligned and multi-payor platform. The composition of our management team has evolved to reflect leadership that is best positioned to execute on the Company’s go-forward strategy and deliver long-term sustainable stockholder value. We have made considerable progress on key initiatives aligned with our strategic imperatives, including our recently completed acquisition of Signify Health, Inc. (“Signify Health”) which adds best-in-class capabilities that enable in-home services and care coordination for patients, and a provider enablement platform. Additionally, in February 2023 we announced the proposed acquisition of Oak Street Health, Inc. (“Oak Street”), a leading multi-payor, value-based primary care provider that is helping older adults stay healthy and live life more fully. Both of the Signify Health and Oak Street acquisitions are expected to advance our value-based care offerings as we continue to redefine how people access and experience care that is more affordable, convenient and connected. The continued investment in our technology platform and digitally enabled services in 2022 expanded our reach to consumers. We now have more than 47 million digital members, who are twice as engaged as non-digital customers, enhancing our ability to reach our consumers as efficiently as possible. The success of our management team is exhibited through the 43% total shareholder return generated over the past two calendar years, 2021 and 2022, representing approximately a 23% outperformance versus the S&P 500 Health Care index. Stockholder Engagement and Corporate Governance Over the past year, our Board and management team continued their long-standing practice of proactive engagement with stockholders to enhance our understanding and to be responsive of your perspectives and needs. As part of discussions with stockholders, we reviewed the business decision made by the Board and management team in 2022 to resolve the vast majority of the pending opioid lawsuits against the Company, which date back to allegations over a decade old. Reaching a global settlement was a priority for the Board and our stockholders, to allow our current leadership team to focus on forward looking strategic imperatives. Additional information on the Board’s considerations is provided within this proxy statement. This was Roger’s first year as Independent Chair of the Board, and we directed efforts on refreshment and committee membership and leadership along with an enhanced Board evaluation process. In September, Dr. Jeffrey Balser joined the Board bringing relevant insight gathered from his experiences in a range of health care roles, including as CEO of Vanderbilt University Medical Center and as a member of the National Academy of Medicine. William Weldon is not standing for re-election at the 2023 Annual Meeting as he has reached the Board’s mandatory retirement age. We thank Bill for his counsel during his tenure on our Board. Environmental, Social and Governance Focus Healthy 2030, our ESG approach, is focused on achieving our economic, environmental and social imperatives and shaping a more equitable and sustainable future for all—across multiple dimensions of health. Our diverse and inclusive workforce reflects the communities we serve and is committed to advancing health equity, bringing care to more people and protecting our environment. Our ESG strategy and initiatives are supported by a strong governance framework, including Board level oversight, thoroughly reviewed goals, an ESG Steering Committee and regular reporting and disclosures. Annual Meeting of Stockholders Our 2023 Annual Meeting will be held virtually on Thursday, May 18, 2023, at 8:00 a.m., Eastern Time, to allow our stockholders to participate more easily regardless of location.

7,Berkshire Hathaway,Insurance: Property and Casualty (Stock),"383,000",302089,675657,-22819,-7.6,BRKA,"To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.: Charlie Munger, my long-time partner, and I have the job of managing the savings of a great number of individuals. We are grateful for their enduring trust, a relationship that often spans much of their adult lifetime. It is those dedicated savers that are forefront in my mind as I write this letter. A common belief is that people choose to save when young, expecting thereby to maintain their living standards after retirement. Any assets that remain at death, this theory says, will usually be left to their families or, possibly, to friends and philanthropy. Our experience has differed. We believe Berkshire’s individual holders largely to be of the once-a-saver, always-a-saver variety. Though these people live well, they eventually dispense most of their funds to philanthropic organizations. These, in turn, redistribute the funds by expenditures intended to improve the lives of a great many people who are unrelated to the original benefactor. Sometimes, the results have been spectacular. The disposition of money unmasks humans. Charlie and I watch with pleasure the vast flow of Berkshire-generated funds to public needs and, alongside, the infrequency with which our shareholders opt for look-at-me assets and dynasty-building. Whowouldn’t enjoy working for shareholders like ours? What WeDo Charlie and I allocate your savings at Berkshire between two related forms of ownership. First, we invest in businesses that we control, usually buying 100% of each. Berkshire directs capital allocation at these subsidiaries and selects the CEOs who make day-by-day operating decisions. When large enterprises are being managed, both trust and rules are essential. Berkshire emphasizes the former to an unusual– some would say extreme– degree. Disappointments are inevitable. We are understanding about business mistakes; our tolerance for personal misconduct is zero. In our second category of ownership, we buy publicly-traded stocks through which we passively own pieces of businesses. Holding these investments, we have no say in management. 3 Our goal in both forms of ownership is to make meaningful investments in businesses with both long-lasting favorable economic characteristics and trustworthy managers. Please note particularly that we own publicly-traded stocks based on our expectations about their long-term business performance, not because we view them as vehicles for adroit purchases and sales. That point is crucial: Charlie and I are not stock-pickers; we are business-pickers. Over the years, I have made many mistakes. Consequently, our extensive collection of businesses currently consists of a few enterprises that have truly extraordinary economics, many that enjoy very good economic characteristics, and a large group that are marginal. Along the way, other businesses in which I have invested have died, their products unwanted by the public. Capitalism has two sides: The system creates an ever-growing pile of losers while concurrently delivering a gusher of improved goods and services. Schumpeter called this phenomenon “creative destruction.” One advantage of our publicly-traded segment is that– episodically– it becomes easy to buy pieces of wonderful businesses at wonderful prices. It’s crucial to understand that stocks often trade at truly foolish prices, both high and low. “Efficient” markets exist only in textbooks. In truth, marketable stocks and bonds are baffling, their behavior usually understandable only in retrospect. Controlled businesses are a different breed. They sometimes command ridiculously higher prices than justified but are almost never available at bargain valuations. Unless under duress, the owner of a controlled business gives no thought to selling at a panic-type valuation. ************ At this point, a report card from me is appropriate: In 58 years of Berkshire management, most of my capital-allocation decisions have been no better than so-so. In some cases, also, bad moves by me have been rescued by very large doses of luck. (Remember our escapes from near-disasters at USAir and Salomon? I certainly do.) Our satisfactory results have been the product of about a dozen truly good decisions– that would be about one every five years– and a sometimes-forgotten advantage that favors long-term investors such as Berkshire. Let’s take a peek behind the curtain. The Secret Sauce In August 1994– yes, 1994– Berkshire completed its seven-year purchase of the 400 million shares of Coca-Cola we now own. The total cost was $1.3 billion– then a very meaningful sumatBerkshire. The cash dividend we received from Coke in 1994 was $75 million. By 2022, the dividend had increased to $704 million. Growth occurred every year, just as certain as birthdays. All Charlie and I were required to do was cash Coke’s quarterly dividend checks. We expect that those checks arehighlylikelytogrow. 4 American Express is much the same story. Berkshire’s purchases of Amex were essentially completed in 1995 and, coincidentally, also cost $1.3 billion. Annual dividends received from this investment have grown from $41 million to $302 million. Those checks, too, seem highly likely to increase. These dividend gains, though pleasing, are far from spectacular. But they bring with them important gains in stock prices. At yearend, our Coke investment was valued at $25 billion while Amex was recorded at $22 billion. Each holding now accounts for roughly 5% of Berkshire’s net worth, akin to its weighting long ago. Assume, for a moment, I had made a similarly-sized investment mistake in the 1990s, one that flat-lined and simply retained its $1.3 billion value in 2022. (An example would be a high-grade 30-year bond.) That disappointing investment would now represent an insignificant 0.3% of Berkshire’s net worth and would be delivering to us an unchanged $80 million or so of annual income. The lesson for investors: The weeds wither away in significance as the flowers bloom. Over time, it takes just a few winners to work wonders. And, yes, it helps to start early and live into your 90s as well. The Past Year in Brief Berkshire had a good year in 2022. The company’s operating earnings– our term for income calculated using Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), exclusive of capital gains or losses from equity holdings– set a record at $30.8 billion. Charlie and I focus on this operational figure and urge you to do so as well. The GAAP figure, absent our adjustment, fluctuates wildly and capriciously at every reporting date. Note its acrobatic behavior in 2022, which is in no way unusual: Earnings in $ billions 2022 Quarter 1 2 3 4 “Operating Earnings” 7.0 9.3 7.8 6.7 GAAPEarnings We are Required to Report 5.5 (43.8) (2.7) 18.2 The GAAP earnings are 100% misleading when viewed quarterly or even annually. Capital gains, to be sure, have been hugely important to Berkshire over past decades, and we expect them to be meaningfully positive in future decades. But their quarter-by-quarter gyrations, regularly and mindlessly headlined by media, totally misinform investors. 5 A second positive development for Berkshire last year was our purchase of Alleghany Corporation, a property-casualty insurer captained by Joe Brandon. I’ve worked with Joe in the past, and he understands both Berkshire and insurance. Alleghany delivers special value to us because Berkshire’s unmatched financial strength allows its insurance subsidiaries to follow valuable and enduring investment strategies unavailable to virtually all competitors. Aided by Alleghany, our insurance float increased during 2022 from $147 billion to $164 billion. With disciplined underwriting, these funds have a decent chance of being cost-free over time. Since purchasing our first property-casualty insurer in 1967, Berkshire’s float has increased 8,000-fold through acquisitions, operations and innovations. Though not recognized in our financial statements, this float has been an extraordinary asset for Berkshire. New shareholders can get an understanding of its value by reading our annually updated explanation of float on page A-2. ************ A very minor gain in per-share intrinsic value took place in 2022 through Berkshire share repurchases as well as similar moves at Apple and American Express, both significant investees of ours. At Berkshire, we directly increased your interest in our unique collection of businesses by repurchasing 1.2% of the company’s outstanding shares. At Apple and Amex, repurchases increased Berkshire’s ownership a bit without any cost to us. The math isn’t complicated: When the share count goes down, your interest in our many businesses goes up. Every small bit helps if repurchases are made at value-accretive prices. Just as surely, when a company overpays for repurchases, the continuing shareholders lose. At such times, gains flow only to the selling shareholders and to the friendly, but expensive, investment banker who recommended the foolish purchases. Gains from value-accretive repurchases, it should be emphasized, benefit all owners– in every respect. Imagine, if you will, three fully-informed shareholders of a local auto dealership, one of whom manages the business. Imagine, further, that one of the passive owners wishes to sell his interest back to the company at a price attractive to the two continuing shareholders. When completed, has this transaction harmed anyone? Is the manager somehow favored over the continuing passive owners? Has the public been hurt? When you are told that all repurchases are harmful to shareholders or to the country, or particularly beneficial to CEOs, you are listening to either an economic illiterate or a silver-tongued demagogue (characters that are not mutually exclusive). 6 Almost endless details of Berkshire’s 2022 operations are laid out on pages K-33– K-66. Charlie and I, along with many Berkshire shareholders, enjoy poring over the many facts and figures laid out in that section. These pages are not, however, required reading. There are many Berkshire centimillionaires and, yes, billionaires who have never studied our financial figures. They simply know that Charlie and I– along with our families and close friends– continue to have very significant investments in Berkshire, and they trust us to treat their money as we do our own. And that is a promise we can make. ************ Finally, an important warning: Even the operating earnings figure that we favor can easily be manipulated by managers who wish to do so. Such tampering is often thought of as sophisticated by CEOs, directors and their advisors. Reporters and analysts embrace its existence as well. Beating “expectations” is heralded as a managerial triumph. That activity is disgusting. It requires no talent to manipulate numbers: Only a deep desire to deceive is required. “Bold imaginative accounting,” as a CEO once described his deception to me, has become one of the shames of capitalism. 58 Years– and a Few Figures In 1965, Berkshire was a one-trick pony, the owner of a venerable– but doomed– New England textile operation. With that business on a death march, Berkshire needed an immediate fresh start. Looking back, I was slow to recognize the severity of its problems. And then came a stroke of good luck: National Indemnity became available in 1967, and we shifted our resources toward insurance and other non-textile operations. Thus began our journey to 2023, a bumpy road involving a combination of continuous savings by our owners (that is, by their retaining earnings), the power of compounding, our avoidance of major mistakes and– most important of all– the American Tailwind. America would have done fine without Berkshire. The reverse is not true. Berkshire now enjoys major ownership in an unmatched collection of huge and diversified businesses. Let’s first look at the 5,000 or so publicly-held companies that trade daily on NASDAQ, the NYSE and related venues. Within this group is housed the members of the S&P 500 Index, an elite collection of large and well-known American companies. In aggregate, the 500 earned $1.8 trillion in 2021. I don’t yet have the final results for 2022. Using, therefore, the 2021 figures, only 128 of the 500 (including Berkshire itself) earned $3 billion or more. Indeed, 23 lost money. 7 At yearend 2022, Berkshire was the largest owner of eight of these giants: American Express, Bank of America, Chevron, Coca-Cola, HP Inc., Moody’s, Occidental Petroleum and Paramount Global. In addition to those eight investees, Berkshire owns 100% of BNSF and 92% of BH Energy, each with earnings that exceed the $3 billion mark noted above ($5.9 billion at BNSF and $4.3 billion at BHE). Were these companies publicly-owned, they would replace two present members of the 500. All told, our ten controlled and non-controlled behemoths leave Berkshire more broadly aligned with the country’s economic future than is the case at any other U.S. company. (This calculation leaves aside “fiduciary” operations such as pension funds and investment companies.) In addition, Berkshire’s insurance operation, though conducted through many individually-managed subsidiaries, has a value comparable to BNSF or BHE. As for the future, Berkshire will always hold a boatload of cash and U.S. Treasury bills along with a wide array of businesses. We will also avoid behavior that could result in any uncomfortable cash needs at inconvenient times, including financial panics and unprecedented insurance losses. Our CEO will always be the Chief Risk Officer– a task it is irresponsible to delegate. Additionally, our future CEOs will have a significant part of their net worth in Berkshire shares, bought with their own money. And yes, our shareholders will continue to save and prosper by retaining earnings. At Berkshire, there will be no finish line. Some Surprising Facts About Federal Taxes During the decade ending in 2021, the United States Treasury received about $32.3 trillion in taxes while it spent $43.9 trillion. Though economists, politicians and many of the public have opinions about the consequences of that huge imbalance, Charlie and I plead ignorance and firmly believe that near-term economic and market forecasts are worse than useless. Our job is to manage Berkshire’s operations and finances in a manner that will achieve an acceptable result over time and that will preserve the company’s unmatched staying power when financial panics or severe worldwide recessions occur. Berkshire also offers some modest protection from runaway inflation, but this attribute is far from perfect. Huge and entrenched fiscal deficits have consequences. The $32 trillion of revenue was garnered by the Treasury through individual income taxes (48%), social security and related receipts (341⁄2%), corporate income tax payments (81⁄2%) and a wide variety of lesser levies. Berkshire’s contribution via the corporate income tax was $32 billion during the decade, almost exactly a tenth of 1% of all money that the Treasury collected. 8 And that means– brace yourself– had there been roughly 1,000 taxpayers in the U.S. matching Berkshire’s payments, no other businesses nor any of the country’s 131 million households would have needed to pay any taxes to the federal government. Not a dime. ************ Millions, billions, trillions– we all know the words, but the sums involved are almost impossible to comprehend. Let’s put physical dimensions to the numbers: • If you convert $1 million into newly-printed $100 bills, you will have a stack that reaches your chest. • Perform the same exercise with $1 billion– this is getting exciting!– and the stack reaches about 3⁄4 of a mile into the sky. • Finally, imagine piling up $32 billion, the total of Berkshire’s 2012-21 federal income tax payments. Now the stack grows to more than 21 miles in height, about three times the level at which commercial airplanes usually cruise. When it comes to federal taxes, individuals who own Berkshire can unequivocally state “I gave at the office.” ************ At Berkshire we hope and expect to pay much more in taxes during the next decade. We owe the country no less: America’s dynamism has made a huge contribution to whatever success Berkshire has achieved– a contribution Berkshire will always need. We count on the American Tailwind and, though it has been becalmed from time to time, its propelling force has always returned. I have been investing for 80 years– more than one-third of our country’s lifetime. Despite our citizens’ penchant– almost enthusiasm– for self-criticism and self-doubt, I have yet to see a time when it made sense to make a long-term bet against America. And I doubt very much that any reader of this letter will have a different experience in the future. Nothing Beats Having a Great Partner Charlie and I think pretty much alike. But what it takes me a page to explain, he sums up in a sentence. His version, moreover, is always more clearly reasoned and also more artfully– some might add bluntly– stated. Here are a few of his thoughts, many lifted from a very recent podcast: • Theworld is full of foolish gamblers, and they will not do as well as the patient investor. • If you don’t see the world the way it is, it’s like judging something through a distorted lens. • All I want to know is where I’m going to die, so I’ll never go there. And a related thought: Early on, write your desired obituary– and then behave accordingly. • If you don’t care whether you are rational or not, you won’t work on it. Then you will stay irrational and get lousy results. 9 • Patience can be learned. Having a long attention span and the ability to concentrate on one thing for a long time is a huge advantage. • Youcan learn a lot from dead people. Read of the deceased you admire and detest. • Don’t bail away in a sinking boat if you can swim to one that is seaworthy. • Agreat company keeps working after you are not; a mediocre company won’t do that. • Warren and I don’t focus on the froth of the market. We seek out good long-term investments and stubbornly hold them for a long time. • Ben Graham said, “Day to day, the stock market is a voting machine; in the long term it’s a weighing machine.” If you keep making something more valuable, then some wise person is going to notice it and start buying. • There is no such thing as a 100% sure thing when investing. Thus, the use of leverage is dangerous. A string of wonderful numbers times zero will always equal zero. Don’t count on getting rich twice. • Youdon’t, however, need to own a lot of things in order to get rich. • You have to keep learning if you want to become a great investor. When the world changes, you must change. • Warren and I hated railroad stocks for decades, but the world changed and finally the country had four huge railroads of vital importance to the American economy. We were slow to recognize the change, but better late than never. • Finally, I will add two short sentences by Charlie that have been his decision-clinchers for decades: “Warren, think more about it. You’re smart and I’m right.” And so it goes. I never have a phone call with Charlie without learning something. And, while he makes me think, he also makes me laugh. ************ I will add to Charlie’s list a rule of my own: Find a very smart high-grade partner– preferably slightly older than you– and then listen very carefully to what he says. AFamily Gathering in Omaha Charlie and I are shameless. Last year, at our first shareholder get-together in three years, we greeted you with our usual commercial hustle. From the opening bell, we went straight for your wallet. In short order, our See’s kiosk sold you eleven tons of nourishing peanut brittle and chocolates. In our P.T. Barnum pitch, we promised you longevity. After all, what else but candy from See’s could account for Charlie and me making it to 99 and 92? I know you can’t wait to hear the specifics of last year’s hustle. On Friday, the doors were open from noon until 5 p.m., and our candy counters rang up 2,690 individual sales. On Saturday, See’s registered an additional 3,931 transactions between 7 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., despite the fact that 61⁄2 of the 91⁄2 operating hours occurred while our movie and the question-and-answer session were limiting commercial traffic. 10 Do the math: See’s rang up about 10 sales per minute during its prime operating time (racking up $400,309 of volume during the two days), with all the goods purchased at a single location selling products that haven’t been materially altered in 101 years. What worked for See’s in the days of Henry Ford’s model T works now. ************ Charlie, I, and the entire Berkshire bunch look forward to seeing you in Omaha on May 5-6. We will have a good time and so will you.",
8,Alphabet,Internet Services and Retailing,"190,234",282836,1330201,59972,21.2,GOOGL,"To our investors,
 2022 was a year full of change and uncertainty around 
the world. In February, when war broke out in Ukraine, 
our teams worked around-the-clock to make sure our 
products were helpful to people who needed them, from 
providing trustworthy information on Search to disrupting 
cyberattacks to partnering with the government to deploy 
air raid alerts. In March, I traveled to Warsaw, Poland, 
where I met Googlers hosting families who sought refuge, 
talked with entrepreneurs using our office spaces, and 
saw how our products like Google Translate were helping 
Ukrainians find a bit of hope and connection.
 By late spring, the tech industry was adjusting to a 
more challenging macroeconomic environment, and 
as a company we embarked on efforts to sharpen our 
focus and make sure our efforts are aligned with our 
highest priorities. Near the end of the year, AI reached 
an inflection point, made possible by our foundational 
breakthroughs like Transformer and advances in diffusion 
models. It was an exciting moment for us after having 
worked to develop the technology responsibly for so 
many years. And on December 18, during the World Cup 
f
 inal, Google Search saw its highest query-per-second 
volume of all time, a strong signal of our momentum.
 Through it all, we launched new products that helped us 
advance our mission: to organize the world’s information 
and make it universally accessible and useful. Over the 
past few years, AI has emerged as the most important 
way we can advance our mission, and in 2022, we made 
some of our biggest technological advancements yet.  
In the area of natural language understanding, our latest 
model, PaLM, demonstrates breakthrough capabilities 
in language, reasoning, and code tasks. Breakthroughs 
in “chain of thought” prompting are helping to build 
systems that can perform multistep reasoning and break 
down complex problems into smaller tasks. We also 
shared new generative models, including Imagen, our 
text-to-image model, and Phenaki, which can generate 
long, coherent videos from text prompts.
 It’s been especially exciting to see how AI advancements 
are making our products more helpful. Last year, we 
launched multisearch, a new way to search using both 
text and images, and it’s now available in more than  
70 languages. People use Lens more than 10 billion  
times per month to search with their camera or images,  
and its new, AI-powered translation feature blends 
translated text seamlessly into the background of images. 
And, thanks to a new machine learning technique, we 
added 24 new languages to Google Translate, including 
its first indigenous languages of the Americas.
 The breakthroughs we’re seeing are poised to transform 
every industry, and we’re helping businesses tap into the 
new opportunities AI creates. Last year, we announced 
new products to help businesses solve problems using 
AI, including Translation Hub, which can be used to 
translate documents into 135 languages at a previously 
unimaginable scale and speed. We brought more 
AI-powered features to Google Workspace, including 
automatic summarization for Google Docs and Chat to 
help people get work done faster. To help advertisers 
create meaningful performance, last year we started 
incorporating large language models into broad match,  
a tool that makes it easier to match advertiser offers  
to search queries.
 In the first few months of 2023, we’ve continued to roll 
out new products and features that help unlock incredible 
opportunities for consumers, partners, and businesses, 
including ours. Among them, we introduced PaLM API,  
an easy and safe way for developers to build on top of our 
language models, and generative AI capabilities in Google 
→
Contents
 Cloud and Workspace. We also launched Bard, an early 
experiment for people to collaborate with generative AI. 
It’s one way we are giving users direct access to large 
language models, and part of a natural journey where 
we’ll continue to iterate and make progress.

 AI is also helping us to find solutions to some of the 
world’s biggest problems. We partnered with iCad to 
license our mammography technology for breast cancer 
screenings, which is being used in clinics for the first 
time. DeepMind’s AlphaFold database grew by orders  
of magnitude, expanding from about one million to  
200 million structures. One million researchers have 
used it around the world to help solve problems in 
sustainability, drug discovery, human biology, and more.
 Beyond AI, we’re excited about the continued momentum 
across our businesses. Just a few examples: YouTube 
Premium is now up to 80 million paying subscribers and 
trialers, an increase of 30 million from the year before. 
And YouTube Shorts is now averaging more than 50 billion 
daily views. We introduced our newest lineup of Pixel 
devices, and our Pixel 6a, Pixel 7, and Pixel 7 Pro are the 
best-selling generation of phones we’ve ever launched. 
And we continue to open cloud regions and invest in data 
centers around the world, including our first-ever data 
center in Japan.
 In September, Google will turn 25. I am grateful to our 
employees, partners, and shareholders everywhere who 
have made this milestone possible, and look forward to 
what the next year – and quarter century – will bring",

10,Chevron,Petroleum Refining,"43,846",246252,311093,35465,14.4,CVX,"to our stockholders The events of 2022 demonstrated the vital role that affordable and reliable energy plays in the world economy. The past year’s volatility illustrates the need for an energy system that balances economic prosperity, energy security and environmental protection. Affordable energy is vital for economies to flourish. Reliable energy is essential for national security. And we all share a stake in a lower carbon future. executing our strategy; delivering results Chevron’s strategy has remained clear: Leverage our strengths to safely deliver lower carbon energy to a growing world. In 2022, we increased investment by more than 75% versus 2021, helping us deliver the highest U.S. production in our history, at 1.2 million barrels of oil‑equivalent per day. Execution of our strategy also enabled delivery on our financial priorities: • Grow the dividend consistently • Invest capital efficiently • Maintain a strong balance sheet, and • Repurchase shares steadily 2022 marked the 35th consecutive year of higher per-share annual dividends, with the company paying out $11 billion to stockholders. And we raised the per-share dividend another 6% in early 2023. We also returned an additional $11.25 billion to stockholders by repurchasing nearly 70 million shares. Through disciplined investment in high-quality assets, Chevron achieved a return on capital employed of more than 20%, the highest since 2011. We strengthened our industry-leading balance sheet, reducing our debt ratio to 12.8% and net debt ratio to 3.3%. Our efficient deployment of capital is expected to drive the growth of both traditional and new energy businesses while continuing to deliver strong returns to investors. Our financial priorities have remained consistent for decades. We reward stockholders with predictable dividend growth, invest for long-term returns, maintain a strong balance sheet to mitigate commodity price risk and buy back shares through the cycle. Chevron Corporation 2022 Annual Report IV the energy landscape Post-pandemic demand recovery, coupled with supply uncertainty, created energy market volatility during the past year. Geopolitical events threatened to disrupt energy supply, OPEC spare capacity declined and inventories were at low levels relative to demand. At the same time, in much of the world, strong consumer spending and increased travel drove an oil demand increase estimated at 2.3 million barrels per day. In 2023 demand is projected to grow to greater than 101 million barrels per day, an all-time high. Natural gas demand declined slightly last year, as higher prices related to supply disruptions resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict prompted fuel substitution and demand destruction, especially in Europe. Global trade flows of liquefied natural gas (LNG) pivoted to Europe, keeping LNG capacity tight. Global natural gas demand is projected to grow in 2023. As growth in the global economy drives greater overall energy demand, investment in lower carbon energy technologies will also continue to grow. “we aim to lead in lower carbon intensity oil, products and natural gas” advancing energy progress Our capabilities, assets and customer relationships are distinct advantages. We’re building on these strengths as we aim to lead in lower carbon intensity oil, products and natural gas and at the same time advance new products and solutions that reduce the carbon intensity of major industries. In 2022, our upstream operations produced 3 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, and we increased upstream capital expenditures by over 40% relative to the prior year. We added 1.1 billion barrels of net oil-equivalent proved reserves, which equates to approximately 97% of net oil-equivalent production for the year. Photo: The NYSE welcomed Chevron in celebration of over 100 years of listing CVX. Chevron Corporation 2022 Annual Report VI In the Permian Basin, unconventional production averaged 707,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day, a 16% increase from 2021 and all-time high. We expect Permian production to grow nearly 10% in 2023. Additional U.S. production increases are expected as deepwater projects in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico come online, including Mad Dog 2 in 2023, Anchor and Whale in 2024 and Ballymore in 2025. By 2026, Chevron’s Gulf of Mexico production is expected to increase ~50% – to around 300,000 barrels of oil‑equivalent per day. We continue to reduce upstream greenhouse gas intensity, which is down 30% from 2016 as teams around the world advance projects focused on energy efficiency, flaring reduction and methane management. Our U.S. Gulf of Mexico facilities are some of the lowest carbon intensity producing assets in the world, and our Permian Basin operations are among the lowest methane emissions per site of any operator. We plan to continue making progress through technology development and partnerships. Our refining system continues to evolve. We received permits for a project at our Pasadena Refinery that is expected to increase light crude oil throughput capacity to 125,000 barrels per day in 2024, allowing the refinery to run more equity crude from the Permian Basin. And we’re doing capital‑efficient unit conversions to process renewable feedstocks at our El Segundo and Pascagoula refineries. As a result of the acquisition of Renewable Energy Group, Chevron is now the second largest U.S. biobased diesel producer. We are steadily advancing toward our guidance of renewable fuels production capacity of 100,000 barrels per day by 2030. We’re using existing distribution channels to place these products in markets where we believe we can capture the highest margin. And we have a renewable diesel expansion project underway at the Geismar biorefinery, which is expected to come online next year and is projected to increase our overall capacity by 30%. Our Chevron Phillips Chemical Company affiliate, along with Qatar Energy, announced final investment decision on construction of a $6 billion integrated polymers complex in Ras Laffan Industrial City, Qatar, and an $8.5 billion integrated polymers complex in Orange, Texas. Chevron New Energies remains focused on helping customers meet their lower carbon ambitions and reducing the carbon intensity of our operations. We’re taking actions to advance the development of larger-scale carbon capture, utilization and storage projects. Chevron Corporation 2022 Annual Report VII “chevron is exploring opportunities to commercialize and scale the next generation of emerging technologies” And we’re making strategic investments to lower costs, using our own assets to pilot new technologies. Investments and partnerships with companies like Svante and Carbon Clean are helping advance the innovation required to reduce the cost of CO2 capture at different types of industrial facilities. We have acquired pore space on the U.S. Gulf Coast that we believe can store over 1 billion tons of CO2 , and are evaluating other potential storage hubs, including three assessment permits offshore Australia. We are leveraging our experience with carbon offsets through our partnership with Restore the Earth Foundation. We have collaborated to plant approximately 3.7 million trees in Louisiana, reforestation work that is expected to deliver nature-based carbon reductions. Chevron has been investing in hydrogen research and development for decades, and we continue to lay the foundation for a high-growth, competitive business. We are working on multiple projects across California and the U.S. Gulf Coast to support future demand. In the Asia-Pacific region, we’re continuing to work with JERA, a long-time partner and customer, to explore codeveloping lower carbon intensity fuels in Australia. In addition, Chevron is exploring opportunities to commercialize and scale the next generation of emerging technologies, including geothermal energy, to grow lower carbon solutions. looking to the future We believe Chevron is well positioned to lead in both traditional and new energy while safely delivering higher returns, lower carbon and superior shareholder value. We’re at the center of one of the world’s greatest challenges – meeting the energy needs of a growing world and doing so in lower carbon ways. We are confident that by harnessing our human energy, we will continue to advance energy progress. Thank you for your support and the continued trust you place in us. Sincerely",

We recently had the pleasure of welcoming to our Board of Directors Drs. Lorence Kim and Redonda Miller, whose experience in healthcare and business leadership roles will serve AmerisourceBergen well. We are focused on adding key skillsets and diverse perspectives to help support our business and strategy as we continue our process of Board succession planning. We also want to offer our sincere thanks and appreciation to Dr. Jane Henney and Mike Long for their meritorious service. Both of them were already well established directors of AmerisourceBergen when I was elected to be CEO, and their advice, wisdom, and counsel are a big part of the AmerisourceBergen of today. Just as we invest in our people, we also invest in our communities, which have grown in scale and geography. With this in mind, we are furthering our ESG initiatives to create healthier futures around the world.

12,Costco Wholesale,General Merchandisers,"304,000",226954,220354,5844,2.6,COST,"Dear Costco Shareholders, Through the years, Costco’s mission has stayed the same: providing our members with quality goods and services at the lowest prices. We follow our Code of Ethics of obeying the law, taking care of our members and employees, respecting our suppliers, and rewarding our shareholders. By staying true to our culture, Costco has continued to succeed, despite the challenging business environment. The past year presented many challenges due to inflationary pressures in commodities, labor and transportation. Our buying staff around the world exhibited diligence and perseverance in developing and executing on strategies to minimize the impact to both our members and the business. Our business model, including limiting SKU counts, focusing on the most productive items, and bringing goods to market in high volumes, can not only sustain but provide opportunities in even challenging circumstances. We had strong operating results in fiscal 2022. Net sales for the 52-week fiscal year totaled $222.7 billion, an increase of 16%, with a comparable sales increase of 14%. Net income for the 52-week fiscal year was $5.8 billion, or $13.14 per diluted share, an increase of 17%. Revenue from membership fees increased 9% to $4.2 billion. With the slowing of the pandemic, we were able to increase the pace of opening warehouses and business centers domestically and internationally, including 23 net new locations: 14 in the U.S., two in Canada, and one each in Mexico, Korea, Japan, Spain, France, Australia and China. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2022, we expanded our operations to New Zealand and Sweden. In June 2022, we purchased the equity interest of our Taiwan operations from our former joint venture partner. Our Kirkland Signature™ brand realized strong global growth in fiscal 2022. As always, we kept our focus on the key priorities of offering new items, providing cost savings and improving quality. New items included BBQ pellets, women’s jeans, reformulated dog food, sauté pans, fresh mini cakes and chicken yakisoba. Our eight e-commerce websites advanced globally with sales growth of 10% in fiscal 2022, on top of a 44% increase the prior year. The majority of that sales growth is due to items such as furniture, TVs, mattresses, appliances, exercise and patio equipment, where our expanded big and bulky delivery capacity improved our service and value. Costco continues to focus on complementing the core warehouse business with e-commerce offerings, with expanded selection in home furnishings, consumer electronics, lawn and garden, health and beauty, apparel and 2-Day Delivery. Costco Next provides members the option to digitally purchase an expanded selection of products directly from vendors at a great value. Our employees are the foundation of Costco’s business, the heart of the Company’s culture, and the driver for our success. In the spirit of acknowledging and rewarding the excellence of our employees, in fiscal 2022, we instituted several wage increases and provided additional benefits to the majority of our employees. Costco is continuing work on sustainability initiatives, reflected in our Sustainability Commitment on Costco.com. These include continuing progress on our Climate Action Plan, decreasing packaging and plastics use, utilizing recycled content when available, and being creative in arranging for more products per transport. We have redoubled our efforts related to diversity and inclusion. We extend our deepest appreciation to our more than 314,000 Costco employees and all our members worldwide, who are the heart and soul of our company. Thank you for your continued support and trust in Costco. We wish for good health, happiness, peace and prosperity for you and your families in the New Year. Sincerely,",
13,Microsoft,Computer Software,"221,000",198270,2146049,72738,36.7,MSFT,"Dear shareholders, colleagues, customers, and partners,
We are living through a time of historic challenge and opportunity. As I write this, the world faces ongoing economic, social, and geopolitical volatility. At the same time, we have entered a new age of AI that will fundamentally transform productivity for every individual, organization, and industry on earth, and help us address some of our most pressing challenges.
This next generation of AI will reshape every software category and every business, including our own. Forty-eight years after its founding, Microsoft remains a consequential company because time and time again—from PC/Server, to Web/Internet, to Cloud/Mobile—we have adapted to technological paradigm shifts. Today, we are doing so once again, as we lead this new era.
Amid this transformation, our mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more remains constant. As a company, we believe we can be the democratizing force for this new generation of technology and the opportunity it will help unlock for every country, community, and individual, while mitigating its risks.
Here are just a few examples of how we are already doing this:
•	Leading electronic health records vendor Epic is addressing some of the biggest challenges facing the healthcare industry today—including physician burnout—by deploying a wide range of copilot solutions built on Azure OpenAI Service and Dragon Ambient eXperience Copilot.
•	Mercado Libre is reducing the time its developers spend writing code by more than 50 percent with GitHub Copilot, as the company works to democratize e-commerce across Latin America.
•	Mercedes-Benz is making its in-car voice assistant more intuitive for hundreds of thousands of drivers using ChatGPT via the Azure OpenAI Service. 
•	Lumen Technologies is helping its employees be more productive, enabling them to focus on higher value-added activities, by deploying Microsoft 365 Copilot.
•	Nonprofit The Contingent is matching foster families with children in need using Dynamics 365, Power BI, and Azure, with an eye on using AI to amplify its work across the US.
•	And, Taiwan’s Ministry of Education has built an online platform to help elementary and high school students learn English using Azure AI.
To build on this progress, we remain convicted on three things: First, we will maintain our lead as the top commercial cloud while innovating in consumer categories, from gaming to professional social networks. Second, because we know that maximum enterprise value gets created during platform shifts like this one, we will invest to accelerate our lead in AI by infusing this technology across every layer of the tech stack. And, finally, we will continue to drive operating leverage, aligning our cost structure with our revenue growth.
As we make progress on these priorities, we delivered strong results in fiscal year 2023, including a record $211 billion in revenue and over $88 billion in operating income. 
A NEW ERA OF AI
There are two breakthroughs coming together to define this new era of AI. The first is the most universal interface: natural language. The long arc of computing has, in many ways, been shaped by the pursuit of increasingly intuitive human-computer interfaces—keyboards, mice, touch screens. We believe we have now arrived at the next big step forward—natural language—and will quickly go beyond, to see, hear, interpret, and make sense of our intent and the world around us.
The second is the emergence of a powerful new reasoning engine. For years, we’ve digitized daily life, places, and things and organized them into databases. But in a world rich with data, what has been most scarce is our ability to reason over it. This generation of AI helps us interact with data in powerful new ways—from completing or summarizing text, to detecting anomalies and recognizing images—to help us identify patterns and surface insights faster than ever.
Together, these two breakthroughs will unlock massive new opportunity. And, in fact, just last month we announced our vision for Copilot, an everyday AI companion. We are building Copilot into all our most used products and experiences and allowing people to summon its power as a standalone app as well. Just like you boot up an OS to access applications or use a browser to visit websites today, our belief is that you will invoke a Copilot to do all those activities and more: to shop, to code, to analyze, to learn, to create.
As a company, any time we approach a transition like this, we do so responsibly. We believe AI should be as empowering across communities as it is powerful, and we’re committed to ensuring it is responsibly built and designed, with safety in mind from the outset. 
OUR OPPORTUNITY
Every customer solution area and every layer of our tech stack will be reimagined for the AI era. And that’s exactly what we’ve already begun to do:
Infrastructure
Four years ago, we first invested in our AI supercomputer, with a goal of building the best cloud for training and inference. Today, it’s being used by our partner OpenAI to power its best-in-class foundation models and services, including one of the fastest-growing consumer apps ever—ChatGPT. NVIDIA, as well as leading AI startups like Adept and Inflection, is also using our infrastructure to build its own breakthrough models. 
More broadly, organizations continue to choose our ubiquitous computing fabric—from cloud to edge—to run their mission-critical applications. We continued to see more cloud migrations to Azure this past fiscal year, as it remains early when it comes to the long-term cloud opportunity. And we also continue to lead in hybrid computing with Azure Arc, which now has 18,000 customers. 
Data and AI
Every AI app starts with data, and having a comprehensive data and analytics platform is more important than ever. Our Intelligent Data Platform brings together operational databases, analytics, and governance so organizations can spend more time creating value and less time integrating their data estate. We also introduced Microsoft Fabric this year, which unifies compute, storage, and governance with a disruptive business model.
With Azure AI, we are making foundation models available as platforms to our customers. We offer the best selection of industry-leading frontier and open models. In January, we made the Azure OpenAI Service broadly available, bringing together advanced models, including ChatGPT and GPT-4, with the enterprise capabilities of Azure. More than 11,000 organizations across industries are already using it for advanced scenarios like content and code generation. Meta chose us this summer as its preferred cloud to commercialize its Llama family of models. And, with Azure AI Studio, we provide a full lifecycle toolchain customers can use to ground these models on their own data, create prompt workflows, and help ensure they are deployed and used safely. 
Digital and app innovation
GitHub Copilot is fundamentally transforming developer productivity, helping developers complete coding tasks 55 percent faster. More than 27,000 organizations have chosen GitHub Copilot for Business, and to date more than 1 million people have used GitHub Copilot to code faster. We also announced our vision for the future of software development with GitHub Copilot X, which will bring the power of AI throughout the entire software development lifecycle. All up, GitHub surpassed $1 billion in annual recurring revenue for the first time this fiscal year. 
We’re also applying AI across our low-code/no-code toolchain to help domain experts across an organization automate workflows, create apps and webpages, build virtual agents, or analyze data, using just natural language with copilots in Power Platform. More than 63,000 organizations have used AI-powered capabilities in Power Platform to date.
Business applications 
We are bringing the next generation of AI to employees across every job function and every line of business with Dynamics 365 Copilot, which works across CRM and ERP systems to reduce burdensome tasks like manual data entry, content generation, and notetaking. In fact, our own support agents are using Copilot in Dynamics 365 Customer Service to resolve more cases faster and without having to call on peers to help. With our Supply Chain Platform, we’re helping customers apply AI to predict and mitigate disruptions. And, with our new Microsoft Sales Copilot, sellers can infuse their customer interactions with data from CRM systems—including both Salesforce and Dynamics—to close more deals. 
All up, Dynamics surpassed $5 billion in revenue over the past fiscal year, with our customer experience, service, and finance and supply chain businesses each surpassing $1 billion in annual sales.
Industry 
Across industries, we are rapidly becoming the partner of choice for any organization looking to generate real value from AI. In healthcare, for example, we introduced the world’s first fully automated clinical documentation application, DAX Copilot. The application helps physicians reduce documentation time by half, freeing them to spend more time face to face with patients. And Epic will integrate it directly into its electronic health records system. 
And, in retail, we introduced new tools to help companies manage their day-to-day operations and digitize their physical stores.
Modern work
We are rapidly evolving Microsoft 365 into an AI-first platform that enables every individual to amplify their creativity and productivity, with both our established applications like Office and Teams, as well as new apps like Designer, Stream, and Loop. Microsoft 365 is designed for today’s digitally connected, distributed workforce.
This year, we also introduced a new pillar of customer value with Microsoft 365 Copilot, which combines next-generation AI with business data in the Microsoft Graph and Microsoft 365 applications to help people be more productive and unleash their creativity at work. Just last month, I was excited to announce that we will make Microsoft 365 Copilot generally available to our commercial customers later this year.
We continue to build momentum in Microsoft Teams across collaboration, chat, meetings, and calls. We introduced a new version of Teams that delivers up to two times faster performance, while using 50 percent less memory. We also introduced Teams Premium to meet enterprise demand for AI-powered features like intelligent meeting recaps. All up, Teams usage surpassed 300 million monthly active users this year.
With Microsoft Viva, we have created a new category for employee experience. Copilot in Viva offers leaders a new way to build high-performance teams by prioritizing both productivity and employee engagement. This year, Viva surpassed 35 million monthly active users.
Security
As the rate and pace of cyberthreats continue to accelerate, security is a top priority for every organization. Our comprehensive, AI-powered solutions give defenders the advantage. With Security Copilot, we’re combining large language models with a domain-specific model informed by our threat intelligence and 65 trillion daily security signals, to transform every aspect of security operations center productivity. 
All up, more than 1 million organizations now count on our comprehensive, AI-powered solutions to protect their digital estates, and our security business surpassed $20 billion in annual revenue, as we help protect customers across clouds and endpoint platforms.  
Search, advertising, and news
We are reshaping daily search and web habits with our new Bing and Microsoft Edge browser, which brings together search, browsing, chat, and AI into one unified experience to deliver better search, more complete answers, a new chat experience, and the ability to generate content. We think of these tools as an AI copilot for the web. 
We are also bringing these breakthrough capabilities to businesses, with Bing Chat Enterprise, which offers commercial data protection, providing an easy on-ramp for any organization looking to get the benefit of next-generation AI today. 
Although it’s early in our journey, Bing users engaged in more than 1 billion chats and created more than 750 million images over the past year as they apply these new tools to get things done. And Edge has taken share for nine consecutive quarters.
More broadly, we continue to expand our opportunity in advertising. This year, Netflix chose us as its exclusive technology and sales partner for its first ad-supported subscription offering, a validation of the differentiated value we provide to any publisher looking for a flexible partner to build and innovate with them.
LinkedIn
The excitement around AI is creating new opportunities across every function—from marketing, sales, service, and finance, to software development and security. And LinkedIn is increasingly where people are going to learn, discuss, and uplevel their skills. We are using AI to help our members and customers connect to opportunities and tap into the experiences of experts on the platform. In fact, our AI-powered articles are already the fastest-growing traffic driver to the network.
All up, LinkedIn’s revenue surpassed $15 billion for the first time this fiscal year, a testament to how mission critical the platform has become to help more than 950 million members connect, learn, sell, and get hired.
Gaming
In gaming, we are rapidly executing on our ambition to be the first choice for people to play great games whenever, wherever, and however they want. With Xbox Game Pass, we are redefining how games are distributed, played, and viewed. Content is the flywheel behind the service’s growth, and our pipeline has never been stronger. It was especially energizing to release Starfield this fall to broad acclaim, with more than 10 million players in the first month post-launch alone.
Earlier this month, we were thrilled to close our acquisition of Activision Blizzard, and we look forward to sharing more in the coming months about how, together, we will bring the joy of gaming to more people around the world.
Devices and creativity
Finally, we’re turning Windows into a powerful new AI canvas with Copilot, which rolled out as part of a Windows 11 update last month. It uniquely incorporates the context and intelligence of the web, your work data, and what you are doing in the moment on your PC to provide better assistance, while keeping your privacy and security at the forefront. Overall, the number of devices running Windows 11 more than doubled in the past year. And we are also transforming how Windows is experienced and managed with Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365, which together surpassed $1 billion in annual revenue for the first time.
OUR RESPONSIBILITY
As we pursue our opportunity, we are also working to ensure technology helps us solve problems—not create new ones. To do this, we focus on four enduring commitments that are central to our mission and that take on even greater importance in this new era. For us, these commitments are more than just words. They’re a guide to help us make decisions across everything we do—as we design and develop products, shape business processes and policies, help our customers thrive, build partnerships, and more —always asking ourselves critical questions to ensure our actions are aligned with them.
How can we expand opportunity?
First, we believe access to economic growth and opportunity should reach every person, organization, community, and country. And although AI can serve as a catalyst for opportunity and growth, we must first ensure everyone has access to the technologies, data, and skills they need to benefit.
To achieve this, we are focused on getting technology into the hands of nonprofits, social entrepreneurs, and other civil society organizations to help them digitally transform, so they can help address some of society’s biggest challenges. This year, we provided nonprofits with over $3.8 billion in discounted and donated technology. Nearly 325,000 nonprofits used our cloud. And to help them tap the potential of AI, we’re building new AI capabilities for fundraising, marketing, and program delivery.
AI will displace some jobs, but it will also create new ones. That’s why we aim to train and certify 10 million people by 2025 with the skills for jobs and livelihoods in an increasingly digital economy. Since July 2020, we’ve helped 8.5 million people, including 2.7 million this year. We’ve also focused on skilling women and underrepresented communities in cybersecurity, working across 28 countries and with nearly 400 US community colleges to scale our efforts.
Finally, to help people learn more about AI, we launched the first online Professional Certificate on Generative AI in partnership with LinkedIn Learning, created AI tools for educators, and held our first AI Community Learning event in the US. These events will be replicated around the world and localized in 10 languages over the next year. We also partnered to launch a Generative AI Skills Grant Challenge to explore how nonprofit, social enterprise, and research or academic institutions can empower the workforce to use this new generation of AI.
How can we earn trust? 
To create positive impact with technology, people need to be able to trust the technologies they use and the companies behind them. For us, earning trust spans the responsible use of AI, protecting privacy, and advancing digital safety and cybersecurity.  
Our commitment to responsible AI is not new. Since 2017, we’ve worked to develop our responsible AI practice, recognizing that trust is never given but earned through action. 
We have translated our AI principles into a core set of implementation processes, as well as tools, training, and practices to support compliance. But internal programs aren’t enough. We also enable our customers and partners to develop and deploy AI safely, including through our AI customer commitments and services like Azure AI Studio, with its content safety tooling and access to our Responsible AI dashboard. 
Building AI responsibly requires that we work with other industry leaders, civil society, and governments to advocate for AI regulations and governance globally. This year, we released our Governing AI Blueprint, which outlines concrete legal and policy recommendations for AI guardrails. We are signatories to the eight voluntary commitments developed with the US White House, and proud of the six additional commitments we’ve made to further strengthen and operationalize the principles of safety, security, and trust. 
The era of AI heightens the importance of cybersecurity, and we deepened our work across the private and public sectors to improve cyber-resilience. We’ve continued to support Ukraine in defending critical infrastructure, detecting and disrupting cyberattacks and cyberinfluence operations, and providing intelligence related to these attacks. Our Microsoft Threat Analysis Center team produced more than 500 intelligence reports to help keep customers and the public informed. And we published our third annual Microsoft Digital Defense Report, sharing our learnings and security recommendations. 
We also remain committed to creating safe experiences online and protecting customers from illegal and harmful content and conduct, while respecting human rights. We supported the Christchurch Call Initiative on Algorithmic Outcomes to address terrorist and violent and extremist content online. And through the World Economic Forum’s Global Coalition for Digital Safety, we co-led the development of new global principles for digital safety. 
Protecting customers’ privacy and giving them control of their data is more important than ever. We’ve begun our phased rollout of the EU Data Boundary, supporting our commercial and public sector customers’ need for data sovereignty. And each month, more than 3 million people exercise their data protection rights through our privacy dashboard, making meaningful choices about how their data is used. 
How can we protect fundamental rights?
In an increasingly digital world, we have a responsibility to promote and protect people’s fundamental rights and address the challenges technology creates. For us, this means upholding responsible business practices, expanding connectivity and accessibility, advancing fair and inclusive societies, and empowering communities. 
In 2023, we worked diligently to anticipate harmful uses of our technology and put guardrails on the use of technologies that are consequential to people’s lives or legal status, create risk of harm, or threaten human rights. We will continue to assess the impact of our technologies, engage our stakeholders, and model and adopt responsible practices and respect for human rights—including across our global supply chain.
Today, our lives are more connected than ever. Access to education, employment, healthcare, and other critical services is increasingly dependent on technology. That’s why we’ve expanded our commitment to bring access to affordable high-speed internet to a quarter of a billion people around the world, including 100 million people in Africa, by the end of 2025. Since 2017, we’ve helped bring internet access to 63 million people, a key first step to ensuring communities will have access to AI and other digital technologies. 
This year, we also continued working toward our five-year commitment to bridge the disability divide with a focus on helping close the accessibility knowledge gap. Seven hundred and fifty-thousand learners enriched their understanding of disability and accessibility in partnership with LinkedIn Learning, Teach Access, and the Microsoft disability community. 
In addition, we’re stepping up efforts to combat online disinformation through new media content provenance technologies—enabling users to verify if an image or video was generated by AI. We continued our efforts to promote racial equity across Microsoft, our ecosystem, and our communities, including our work to advance justice reform through data-driven insights. And we provided support in response to eight humanitarian disasters, including committing $540 million of support to those who have been impacted by the War in Ukraine. 
Finally, recognizing AI’s potential to advance human rights and humanitarian action, we worked on several AI for Humanitarian Action projects. Together with our partners, we’re building the capabilities to identify at-risk communities, estimate seasonal hunger, predict malnutrition, and assist in disease identification. 
How can we advance sustainability?
Climate change is the defining issue of our generation, and addressing it requires swift, collective action and technological innovation. We are committed to meeting our own goals while enabling others to do the same. That means taking responsibility for our operational footprint and accelerating progress through technology. 
We continue to see extreme weather impacting communities globally. To meet the urgent need, this must be a decade of innovation and decisive action—for Microsoft, our customers, and the world. 
In our latest Environmental Sustainability Report, we shared our progress toward our 2030 sustainability targets across carbon, water, waste, and ecosystems. In 2022, our overall carbon emissions declined by 0.5 percent while our business grew. Addressing scope 3 emissions, which account for the vast majority of our emissions, is arguably our ultimate challenge—one we’ll continue to tackle through our supply chain, policy advances, and industry-wide knowledge-sharing.
We’ve provided just under 1 million people with access to clean water and sanitation, one of five pillars on our path to becoming water positive. And in our pursuit to be zero waste, we achieved a reuse and recycle rate of 82 percent for all our cloud hardware and diverted over 12,000 metric tons of solid operational waste from landfills and incinerators. 
We also continue to take responsibility for the impacts of our direct operations on Earth’s ecosystems. We’ve contracted to protect 17,268 acres of land, over 50 percent more than the land we use to operate. Of that, 12,270 acres—the equivalent of approximately 7,000 soccer fields—were designated as permanently protected. 
Technology is a powerful lever to help us avoid the most severe impacts of climate change. That’s why we’re accelerating our investment in more efficient datacenters, clean energy, enhancements to the Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability and Planetary Computer, and green software practices. To date, through our Climate Innovation Fund, we’ve allocated more than $700 million to a global portfolio of 50+ investments spanning sustainable solutions in energy, industrial, and natural systems. 
Finally, we believe AI can be a powerful accelerant in addressing the climate crisis. We expanded our AI for Good Lab in Egypt and Kenya to improve climate resilience for the continent. And, together with our partners, we launched Global Renewables Watch, a first-of-its-kind living atlas that aims to map and measure utility-scale solar and wind installations, allowing users to evaluate progress toward a clean energy transition. 
Although this new era promises great opportunity, it demands even greater responsibility from companies like ours. As we pursue our four commitments, we focus on transparency—providing clear reporting on how we run our business and how we work with customers and partners. Our annual Impact Summary shares more about our progress and learnings this year, and our Reports Hub provides detailed reports on our environmental data, political activities, workforce demographics, human rights work, and more. 
OUR CULTURE
There’s never been a more important time to live our culture. The way we work and the speed at which we work are changing. 
In an economy where yesterday’s exceptional is today’s expected, all of us at Microsoft will need to embrace a growth mindset and, more importantly, confront our fixed mindsets as our culture evolves. It will take everyday courage to reformulate what innovation, business models, and sales motions look like in this new era. As a high-performance organization, we aspire to help our employees maximize their economic opportunity, while simultaneously helping them learn and grow professionally and connect their own passion and purpose with their everyday work and the company’s mission.
To be successful, we need to be grounded in what our customers and the world need. We need to innovate and collaborate as One Microsoft. And we need to actively seek diversity and embrace inclusion to best serve our customers and create a culture where everyone can do their best work. To empower the world, we need to represent the world. To that end, we remain focused on increasing representation and strengthening our culture of inclusion. Even as we navigated challenges this year, our company continued to be the most globally diverse it’s ever been. 
Giving also remains core to our culture. This year, more than 105,000 employees gave $242 million (including company match) to over 35,000 nonprofits in 116 countries. And our employees volunteered over 930,000 hours to causes they care about.
I am deeply grateful to our employees for their commitment to the company and their communities, and how they are living our mission and culture every day in a changing company and world.
**
In closing, this is Microsoft’s moment. We have an incredible opportunity to use this new era of AI to deliver meaningful benefits for every person and every organization on the planet. 
On New Year’s Day, I saw a tweet from Andrej Karpathy, Tesla’s former director of AI who now works at OpenAI, about how GitHub Copilot was writing about 80 percent of his code, with 80 percent accuracy. Two days later, I saw a stunning example of work we’ve done with the government of India’s Ministry of Electronics and IT, which is applying an AI model so farmers in rural areas can interact with government resources in their native languages. 
Think about that: A foundation model that was developed on the West Coast of the United States is already transforming the lives of both elite developers and rural farmers on the other side of the globe. We’ve not seen this speed of diffusion and breadth of impact in the tech industry before.
As a company, this is our moment to show up and responsibly build solutions that drive economic growth and benefit every community, country, industry, and person. If we do it well, the world will do well, and Microsoft will do well too. I’ve never been more confident that we will deliver on this promise together in the days, months, and years to come. ",
14,Cardinal Health,Wholesalers: Health Care,"46,035",181364,19452,-933,-0.5,CAH,"Dear shareholders, As I step into my new role as CEO of Cardinal Health, I want to express my gratitude for the trust and confidence our Board of Directors is placing in me. It is a privilege to take on this new responsibility and move our organization forward. I also want to acknowledge my predecessor, Mike Kaufmann. Mike was part of this company and industry for more than 30 years and, like many, I’m inspired by his passion for Cardinal Health and his drive to make healthcare better. He joined Cardinal Health as a director in finance before progressing through roles in sales, procurement, general management and senior leadership across our business segments and the corporate enterprise. Mike is well-known for his integrity, authenticity and humility. He helped build Cardinal Health into what it is today: a Fortune 15 company that improves lives every day as a distributor of pharmaceuticals, a global manufacturer and distributor of medical and laboratory products, and a provider of performance and data solutions for healthcare facilities. On behalf of all of us at Cardinal Health, I’d like to thank Mike for his many years of service to our customers and partners, to the patients they care for, to our employees and to the communities where we live and work. Our fiscal 2022 financial performance Fiscal 2022 brought great challenges to our customers, to our industry and to Cardinal Health. I have been both impressed and inspired by the work of our customers and am tremendously proud of the dedication and resilience of our employees around the world as they continue to rise to meet these challenges. Despite the often difficult year, we generated $3.1 billion of operating cash flow, enabling both the return of capital to shareholders and future investment to support our strategic priorities. This, in addition to our strong balance sheet, positions us well to deploy capital in the best interest of shareholders. We did not hit all of our fiscal 2022 performance targets, primarily due to the inflation and supply chain constraints that significantly impacted our Medical Segment performance.However, our Pharmaceutical Segment finished the year
strong at 5% segment profit growth, consistent with our
guidance and driven by continued stability in overall
pharmaceutical demand and within our generics program.
This continued stability in our generics program, our strong
positioning with a diverse customer base and our investments
in technology and innovation position the Pharmaceutical
Segment well for continued future growth.
Moving forward
We recently announced that Debbie Weitzman, formerly
President of Pharmaceutical Distribution at Cardinal Health,
became CEO of the company's Pharmaceutical Segment,
effective September 19. Weitzman replaces Victor Crawford,
who will remain with Cardinal Health until November 13
to ensure a smooth transition. The role of President of
Pharmaceutical Distribution will be eliminated, and we
are further streamlining the Pharmaceutical Segment
by restructuring and eliminating additional roles. The
Pharmaceutical and Specialty Distribution businesses will
both report directly to Debbie Weitzman. I believe this
new design will allow us to have added focus on specialty
distribution, which is a key growth area for the company,
and to simplify how our customers and manufacturers

This is an unmistakable conclusion from our collective experiences over the past few years. With good health, individuals are happier and more fulfilled, companies and organizations thrive, and our communities are stronger. Without it, challenges and uncertainties can feel insurmountable. Recognizing the foundational role of good health in our society at every level, we are doubling down to do even more. In 2022, we launched the Evernorth Vitality Index1 to better understand the factors influencing an individual’s ability to not just survive but to thrive. We evolved our mission — clarifying that the reason we exist is to improve the health and vitality of those we serve. And we set a bold goal to increase the health of the lives we touch. 2 • THE CIGNA GROUP 2022 ANNUAL REPORT Our vision for the health care system is built on the vitality of every individual and every community, and this means delivering on the promise of: • Personalized, digital-first health care access and experiences at scale; • Advanced care models for conditions, diseases and episodes with superior value; and • Seamlessly connected pharmacy, medical and behavioral health services. This is what we are working toward by harnessing the capabilities within our company and convening others through relationships with our partners. It is also what drives and fuels the passion of our more than 70,000 co-workers around the world. We all recognize the inevitable day each of us, or a loved one, will need to turn to the health care system with our own health challenge. Given the level of talent, capabilities and expertise we possess as a company, we view it as both our responsibility and our privilege to ensure the health care system responds by keeping good health and, therefore, vitality in reach for everyone. We will continue to support the health and vitality of customers, patients, clients and communities in ways that drive all of us forward in connecting for a healthier future. Our results and progress To fulfill these commitments, we have continued to strengthen and evolve our capabilities, and we also have refreshed our brands to reflect the unique value we bring with our broad portfolio. The Cigna Group is the new name of our corporation, and we bring our mission and vision to life through our two growth platforms, Evernorth Health Services and Cigna Healthcare. Guided by our durable strategic growth framework, we leverage our platforms as we work each and every day to fulfill our promises to our key stakeholders. In 2022, both Evernorth Health Services and Cigna Healthcare delivered strong value for the benefit of our customers, patients, clients and partners, and, as a result, we achieved strong financial results for our investors. Our company: • Grew total revenues to $180.5 billion.2 • Achieved shareholders’ net income of $6.7 billion, or $21.30 per share, and adjusted income from operations of $7.3 billion.2,3 • Returned $9 billion to shareholders via a combination of share repurchases and dividends.2 3 • THE CIGNA GROUP 2022 ANNUAL REPORT EVERNORTH HEALTH SERVICES Evernorth Health Services performed well in 2022 with its Pharmacy Benefits Services, Specialty Pharmacy and Evernorth Care businesses providing market-leading innovation and affordability. Throughout 2022, Evernorth Health Services continued to drive a digital-first approach to care with MDLIVE serving as the engine for virtual care. Last year alone, total MDLIVE patient visits grew by approximately 20 percent,4 including substantial growth in the virtual primary care program we introduced. Today, MDLIVE offers virtual primary, urgent, behavioral and dermatological care, which is expanding access, enhancing experiences and improving affordability for customers. Evernorth Health Services’ pharmacy solutions are also increasing the value of each dollar spent on medication and driving to the lowest net cost while ensuring quality outcomes. The highest therapy completion rates in the market are a key part of this success. This applies to specialty and gene therapy costs, which comprise as much as half of total drug spending5 even though specialty drugs are used by less than 2 percent of the population. Biosimilars offer growing opportunities to lower costs for patients, clients and partners, and our leading specialty pharmacy capabilities give us a differentiated position to create value. Today, approximately 7 percent of our specialty drug spend has a biosimilar or generic equivalent on the market, and this will likely increase to more than 25 percent by 2026.4 Over time, we believe this will translate to a $100 billion market opportunity.6 And we expect to manage almost $30 billion of this market opportunity, driving significant savings for patients and clients as more biosimilar equivalents come to market.4 As a result of the value Evernorth Health Services is generating for the benefit of those we serve, we continue to be a partner of choice across health care and have established significant new relationships with Kaiser Permanente7 and Centene.8 Pharmacy Benefits Home Delivery Pharmacy Specialty Pharmacy Distribution Care Delivery and Management Solutions 4 • THE CIGNA GROUP 2022 ANNUAL REPORT CIGNA HEALTHCARE Cigna Healthcare, our benefits portfolio, includes our U.S. Commercial, U.S. Government and International Health businesses. Together, these businesses are delivering products and services that meet the needs of employers of all sizes as well as individuals. In U.S. Commercial, we drove strong growth, demonstrating how much clients appreciate our in-depth expertise and consultative approach, as well as the continued progress we are making with affordability. We are committed to being a differentiated partner of choice in helping individuals and their companies thrive in a time when employees increasingly are looking to their employers for health and well-being needs. Our U.S. Government business provides an important growth opportunity for our company, and, in 2022, we continued to support individuals with plans for their personal health and well-being needs, for their lifestyle, and that fit within their budget. We continued our progress in strengthening our offerings as well as our work doubling the size of our Medicare Advantage provider network over the past two years.4,9 In our Individual and Family Plans business in 2022, we maintained our long-standing and continued commitment to participating in the ACA exchange marketplace, expanding our footprint and capabilities that provide positive experiences for those we serve. Our International Health business contributed strong revenue and earnings in 2022. In addition, we completed the divestiture of our life, accident and supplemental benefits businesses across seven markets. We will continue to sharpen our focus on meeting the health and wellbeing needs in attractive growth markets and for the globally mobile. Throughout the year, our Cigna Healthcare segment continued to find more ways of delivering value in the wake of COVID-19 as individuals and employers looked not only for medical benefits — they were looking for ways to increase their overall vitality. U.S. Commercial U.S. Government International Health 5 • THE CIGNA GROUP 2022 ANNUAL REPORT CROSS-COMPANY COLLABORATION Evernorth Health Services and Cigna Healthcare have delivered impactful results on their own. And, when they work together, they accelerate innovation and create new solutions for our clients and customers by leveraging our entire suite of capabilities, including our longitudinal portfolio of data. Our Cigna Pathwell program is a prime example. Cigna Pathwell Specialty connects patients with convenient, quality and affordable options for drug infusions through Cigna Healthcare’s provider network. The newest Cigna Pathwell program, Cigna Pathwell Bone & Joint, connects patients to Cigna Healthcare’s provider network, as well as its personalized benefit designs, physical therapy options (both virtually and in person), behavioral health services and peer support. Through Evernorth Health Services’ analytics, our team can predict potential surgeries up to a year in advance and offer holistic care while also decreasing unnecessary surgeries that can drive up costs. When surgery is necessary, the members’ benefits will cover the procedure at low-to-no cost from admission to discharge.10 Another example of the power of our cross-company collaboration is a new multi-year strategic relationship with VillageMD.11 Through VillageMD, we are transforming how care is accessed, delivered and coordinated for better health outcomes and affordability. Operating more than 250 primary care practices across 22 markets, VillageMD is one of the largest independent primary care groups in the United States. VillageMD physicians and patients partner closely with Cigna Healthcare and also benefit from Evernorth Health Services, including real-time data and clinical insights at the point of diagnosis, enhanced virtual care options through MDLIVE, and dedicated pathways to specialty care and condition management capabilities. 6 • THE CIGNA GROUP 2022 ANNUAL REPORT When Evernorth Health Services and Cigna Healthcare work together, they accelerate innovation and create new solutions for our clients and customers. 7 • THE CIGNA GROUP 2022 ANNUAL REPORT Making an impact Our commitment to improve the health and vitality of those we serve guides how we operate our businesses, as well as how we engage and support our communities. We are honored by the recognition our efforts have earned, including being listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices for a sixth consecutive year12 and ranking No. 1 within health care among America’s Most JUST companies by JUST Capital and CNBC.13 In 2022, we continued to make strides across the four pillars of our environmental, social and governance framework: Healthy Environment, Healthy Society, Healthy Workforce and Healthy Company. HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT We see an inextricable link between the health of our environment and people’s health. This has spurred our commitment to do more. In 2022, we signed the RE100 global corporate renewable energy initiative and pledged to transition to 100 percent renewable electricity by 2030. In addition, we see an opportunity to measure the positive impact on the environment with a number of ways we are advancing our business. Telemedicine can help to reduce the carbon footprint of health care by reducing emissions because patients do not need to travel for care. Our continued investment in virtual care is one important way we will support a healthy environment. 8 • THE CIGNA GROUP 2022 ANNUAL REPORT HEALTHY SOCIETY Recognizing that some communities face greater challenges than others in supporting the health of their citizens, we maintain our longstanding focus on reducing disparities, addressing social determinants of health and creating a more sustainable health care system. We continue to advance our Building Equity and Equality Program, a five-year commitment to accelerate our health equity and DE&I efforts, and are particularly encouraged by innovative opportunities to address racial disparities in pre-term births. By working with health care providers and convening services that include free home delivery of prenatal vitamins, transportation for medical appointments, nutrition and emotional support, we aim to reduce disparities in pregnancy-related complications among African American women in Baltimore, Houston and Memphis, where we have launched our pre-term birth program. We partner with providers to think beyond the clinical setting to best support the holistic care of their patients. We reward value-based providers to screen for social needs and make appropriate referrals for support and to identify health disparities impacting their patient population and develop an action plan to close gaps. We are also working to embed health equity into our culture, systems, policies and practices. Starting in 2021, we reviewed all our existing and new medical coverage policies through a health equity lens and, as a result, made changes to our policies that put us on the forefront of driving advancements in equitable access to care. The commitment to our leadership role in making a positive impact in our communities is core to our business and embraced by our co-workers. Dr. Luis Torres is a shining example, among so many others across our company, of co-workers personally dedicated to making a difference. Dr. Torres worked to drive policy change addressing health equity for racial and social justice when representing The Cigna Group during the CEO Action for Racial Equity fellowship in 2022.14 HEALTHY WORKFORCE Within our company, we support transparency as we advance an inclusive culture honoring the unique talents and perspectives of our co-workers. Last year, we published our full-year 2021 Diversity Scorecard Report, reinforcing our commitment and progress in creating an environment where members of our team are able to bring their best selves to work, leaving us better able to serve the diverse needs of our customers, clients and communities.15 9 • THE CIGNA GROUP 2022 ANNUAL REPORT Our Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I) Council continued to provide valuable leadership in guiding our DE&I strategy, helping us strengthen our approaches within our company and in our communities. Caring deeply about our customers, patients and co-workers is a value ingrained in our culture, and we are proud of the many ways our team brings this to life, including through our Community Ambassador Fellowship Program. Each year, we select up to 15 employees who receive paid leave and additional support to work with a nonprofit partner in addressing health and well-being needs. Our 2022 class of ambassador fellows worked on projects such as humanitarian and psychological support for refugees, help for adult survivors of childhood abuse, education around addiction, and the creation of equitable opportunities for high school students. We are encouraged by the impact we are seeing with our wide-ranging approach and are pleased to be recognized among DiversityInc’s Top 50 Companies for Diversity for a fifth year in a row.16 We also understand the added challenges that many of our employees have faced over the past few years, and we have worked to increase the support we provide them. We initially offered emergency time off in 2021, and as the Omicron variant of COVID-19 spread rapidly at the beginning of 2022, we extended that benefit for our employees. In addition to increased flexibility, we also expanded our caregiver leave program to include care for grandparents and grandchildren in addition to children, spouses and parents with a serious health condition. HEALTHY COMPANY We have a deep and long-held commitment to strong governance as well as ethical and resilient business practices. The strength of our Board of Directors contributes meaningfully to upholding these commitments. Approximately 70 percent of our directors have served on our Board for fewer than six years, which demonstrates how we continue to bring new and relevant perspectives and skill sets into our company. Throughout 2022, our Board composition exceeded the S&P benchmarks on median age, tenure, gender and ethnic diversity. Our company is purposeful about whom we work with as we seek suppliers that share our values and are committed to operating in a responsible manner. We continue to make progress in creating and supporting a diverse supplier base, and we are honored by the National Minority Supplier Development Council as being among the Forefront 50 corporations showing leadership in creating greater economic access and equity for systematically excluded entrepreneurs of color.17 10 • THE CIGNA GROUP 2022 ANNUAL REPORT Building for the future 2022 was a strong year of performance, growth and positive impact for our company. With Evernorth Health Services and Cigna Healthcare, we demonstrated that we are serving the needs of our customers, clients and partners, and we expect to deliver another year of customer and earnings growth in 2023.2 We are making a defining difference in health care, and we are committed to building on our momentum by taking on new challenges where we are positioned to lead. It is a profound privilege to lead more than 70,000 colleagues around the world who demonstrate personal dedication to our refreshed mission to improve the health and vitality of those we serve. I’m inspired by the way they guide patients to the care they need, work with employers in supporting their people and always seek more ways we can help. Each and every day, we are bringing to life our vision of a better future, built on the vitality of every individual and every community.",
16,Marathon Petroleum,Petroleum Refining,"17,800",180012,59544,14516,8.1,MPC,"FROM THE PRESIDENT AND CEO Fellow Shareholders, Throughout a highly volatile year in global energy markets, Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC) demonstrated significant progress on our three strategic pillars, and we delivered on our commitments to performance, optimization and value creation. Executing on our operating, commercial and financial objectives, combined with a strong macro-economic environment, led to superior total shareholder returns in 2022 of 87%. At the same time, we continued to deepen our environmental, social and governance (ESG) efforts to drive long-term benefits for our business and stakeholders. In 2022, we leveraged structural improvements we made in our commercial and operational execution to meet robust customer demand and capture strong margin opportunities. Our commitment to safe, reliable and environmentally sound operations enabled us to run our refining system at 96% utilization for the year, which included operating at full utilization in the second quarter, when demand for the transportation fuels we manufacture was highest. MPC generated $16.4 billion of cash from operations in 2022. We returned nearly $12 billion to shareholders through share repurchases during the year, bringing total repurchases between May 2021 and the end of 2022 to almost $17 billion. Demonstrating our commitment to a secure, competitive and growing dividend, in November, we increased MPC’s quarterly dividend by 30%. Challenging ourselves to lead in sustainable energy, we made significant progress on our Martinez Renewables facility and further optimized our Dickinson Renewables facility; we added two substantial 2030 goals to our emissions reduction targets; and we set a new industry record for the number of refineries certified for superior energy efficiency performance in one year through the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) ENERGY STAR® program. MPC 2022 ANNUAL REPORT 1 DEVELOPING ENDURING CAPABILITIES In early 2020, we introduced our three strategic pillars: strengthening the competitive position of our assets, fostering a low-cost culture, and improving our commercial performance. Since then, they have become a foundational part of MPC’s DNA, aligning our efforts to increase profitability and drive long-term value creation. We continue to be committed to these three strategic pillars today, because they address foundational aspects of our business that are within our control. While there is more to do, I am very proud of our progress in these areas, which was reflected in our 2022 performance. We’ve achieved and sustained cost reductions while never compromising the safety of our employees or assets, made purposeful moves to strengthen our portfolio, and implemented commercial and operational improvements that can deliver incremental value into the future. Importantly, while we’ve positioned ourselves for the future over the last few years, we’ve remained grounded in our Core Values, which guide us to hold steadfast in our commitment to safe and environmentally responsible operations, to find and create shared value, and to set and hold ourselves accountable to high expectations. STRENGTHENING THE COMPETITIVE POSITION OF OUR ASSETS In September, we completed the formation of our Martinez Renewables joint venture with Neste, which enhances the value of the project to convert our idled Martinez, California, refinery into a renewable fuels facility. The facility is expected to ramp up to produce 730 million gallons per year of renewable fuels by the end of 2023, with pretreatment capabilities expected to come online midyear 2023. At our Dickinson, North Dakota, renewable diesel facility, we optimized operations to accommodate more advantaged feedstocks, which lower the carbon intensity of the fuels we produce and further improve its economic potential. In midstream, segment adjusted EBITDA grew 7% year over year, and the strength and stability of our logistics capabilities helped us navigate market fluctuations. MPLX advanced several organic growth projects in the Permian Basin and remained a source of growing distributions for MPC and other unitholders. In November, MPLX raised its quarterly distribution by 10%. At this current level, MPC is expected to receive approximately $2 billion of annual distributions from MPLX. CONTINUED CAPITAL AND COST DISCIPLINE Our success embedding a low-cost culture across the company enabled us to sustain our previously achieved $1.5 billion of structural cost reduction. We remain focused on achieving operational excellence by reducing costs within our control, improving efficiency, driving operational improvements and being disciplined in capital allocation. We also worked hard to mitigate higher energy input costs throughout the year, and we believe our sustained, structural cost reductions help us to more readily adapt to market fluctuations. We continue to build upon our Focus on Energy (FOE) program, which uses key performance indicators to guide energy management and promote energy efficiency across our refineries. In 2022, FOE-related initiatives led to more than $50 million in energy cost savings for the year, while avoiding 31,700 metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions per month. IMPROVING COMMERCIAL PERFORMANCE Over the past 18 months, we have meaningfully changed our commercial approach across the company and strengthened our teams. To unlock value, we have empowered our people to optimize across our integrated system, more effectively leverage our scale and proximity to key supply sources and demand hubs, and improve product placement. A near-term focus has been securing advantaged renewable feedstocks as we continue to advance our renewable fuels production capabilities. This includes exploring joint venture opportunities and strategic alliances within the renewable fuels value chain, as well as looking to expand upon the partnerships we’ve built with Neste and ADM. In June, our Green Bison Soy Processing joint venture with ADM began construction of North Dakota’s first dedicated soybean processing plant. By the seasonal harvest of 2023, it is expected to begin supplying approximately 600 million pounds a year of locally advantaged, refined soybean oil exclusively to MPC, helping us further optimize feedstock sourcing for renewable diesel production at our Dickinson facility. We continued to progress our Galveston Bay STAR project, which we expect to complete in the first quarter of 2023. The remaining scope of this strategic project is targeted to increase crude oil processing capacity by 40,000 barrels per calendar day, improve residual upgrading capacity by 17,000 barrels per calendar day, enhance diesel recovery, and enable the facility to process more advantaged crude oil. OUR PATH TO LEADING IN SUSTAINABLE ENERGY Across our integrated system, we are meeting the energy needs of today while investing in an energy-diverse future. Our approach to sustainability, which we apply across the components of ESG, is key to our success in this effort. We continue to focus on positioning MPC to lead in an energydiverse world by strengthening the resiliency of our business through reducing our carbon footprint and conserving natural resources; innovating for the future by investing in renewables and emerging technologies; and embedding sustainability in decision-making and in how we engage our stakeholders. To help drive advancement, we have set meaningful targets to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, methane emissions and freshwater intensity. We believe our continued progress demonstrates a tangible FROM THE PRESIDENT AND CEO 2 MPC 2022 ANNUAL REPORT path to achieving these milestones. In 2022, we established a goal to reduce our absolute Scope 3, category 11 GHG emissions to 15% below 2019 levels by 2030, becoming the first large downstream company to set an absolute Scope 3 target. We also expanded our existing goal for reducing methane emissions intensity across our natural gas gathering and processing business, creating a new long-range target of lowering intensity 75% from 2016 levels by 2030. Similarly, to ensure we have the diversity of thought necessary to shape our future, we continue to include a diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) component in the metrics that determine our annual bonus compensation. Established in 2021, we were the first U.S. independent refiner to link a DE&I metric to executive and employee compensation. We also remain focused on being a good neighbor in our communities through meaningful relationships with key stakeholders to understand needs and concerns, define priorities and pursue shared goals. In 2022, the company invested more than $20 million in the communities where we live and work as well as in the broader causes that united many of us, and our employees contributed more than $4 million in additional support. We continue to allocate significant growth capital to low carbon projects, particularly around increasing our production of renewable fuels and natural gas. In fact, MPC is projected to become one of the largest global producers of renewable diesel in early 2024, and MPLX assets currently process about 10% of the natural gas in the United States. MPC and MPLX are also actively involved in publicprivate alliances to explore and develop pathways for emerging opportunities around carbon capture, utilization and sequestration (CCUS), as well as hydrogen energy production and utilization. LOOKING FORWARD in 2023, I’m more optimistic than ever about MPC’s evolving role in meeting the world’s need for reliable, affordable and responsibly produced energy. We anticipate that demand recovery for our products will continue and global supply constraints will persist in 2023. Our strategic pillars and financial priorities remain foundational, supporting our resiliency through near-term economic and geopolitical uncertainties. We will continue to focus our attention on how we run the business, always striving to be well-positioned to create value for our stakeholders regardless of the market’s tailwinds or turbulence. Our goal is to position MPC as the refiner of choice, generating the most cash through cycle, and delivering superior returns to our shareholders, with our steadfast commitment to returning capital. Our achievements are a testament to the skills, dedication and adaptability of our people, who are enthusiastic about the opportunities ahead for our company. Our workforce demonstrated tremendous effort in 2022 – to meet demand for our products, to safely maintain and operate our assets and to support many value-creating programs and strategies that are critical for our long-term success. I am proud to lead MPC, and I am thankful and grateful for the work our people do each day to deliver value for our business and our shareholders. Thank you for supporting our company. Sincerely,",

18,Valero Energy,Petroleum Refining,"9,743",171189,51351,11528,6.7,VLO,"Dear Stockholder, Reflecting back, the COVID-19 pandemic had an extraordinary impact on families, communities and businesses across the globe. The energy business was among those confronted by unprecedented demand contraction. Despite the pandemic-imposed challenges and several severe weather events, we remained steadfast in the execution of our strategy, pursuing excellence in operations, investing for resilience and earnings growth with a comprehensive roadmap to further reduce emissions through economic low-carbon projects and honoring our commitment to stockholder returns. A Record Year In 2022, we delivered strong financial performance, earning a record net income of $29.04 per share. In addition, 2022 was also our best year ever for combined employee and contractor safety, a testament to our long-standing commitment to safe, reliable and environmentally responsible operations. We continued to maximize refining utilization in a safe, reliable and environmentally responsible manner as product demand through our wholesale system surpassed 2019’s pre-pandemic levels, and we ended the year strong, with our refineries running at 97% capacity utilization, our highest capacity utilization since 2018. Our renewable diesel business set another sales volume record in the fourth quarter with the startup of our Diamond Green Diesel (“DGD”) joint venture’s new Port Arthur plant. The project was completed under budget and ahead of schedule and brings DGD’s total annual production capacity to approximately 1.2 billion gallons of renewable diesel and approximately 50 million gallons of renewable naphtha. On the financial side, we continued to strengthen our balance sheet, completing the payoff of all of the incremental debt incurred during the pandemic and ending the year with $4.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents. The debt to capitalization ratio, net of cash and cash equivalents, was approximately 21% as of December 31, 2022, down from the pandemic high of 40% at the end of March 2021, which was largely the result of the $4 billion of debt incurred during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also honored our commitment to stockholders, returning $6.1 billion through dividends and stock purchases. Lastly, we expanded board diversity with 7 of 11 (64%) Independent Directors representing gender or racial/ethnic diversity. Steadfast Execution of Our Strategy None of this would have been possible without Team Valero’s steadfast execution of the strategy that has been in place for nearly a decade. The tenants of this strategy which enable us to meet the challenge of supplying the world’s need for reliable and affordable energy in an environmentally responsible manner are: Maintain manufacturing excellence through safe, reliable and environmentally responsible operations. • We have and will continue to invest to maintain our best-in-class refining assets. • Ten of our refineries have achieved OSHA VPP Star Site status, which is the most approved for any refiner. • Mechanical availability continues to trend upwards, and the trailing three-year average has remained above 97% since 2018. • We continue to set records for our critical safety and environmental metrics. • This relentless focus has benchmarked us as one of the most efficient and lowest operating cost producers among our peers, with the lowest operating cost in our peer group every year since 2013. Grow earnings through market expansion, margin improvement and operating cost control, with rigorous investment evaluation and execution. • We continue to invest to improve margins and light product yields with the Port Arthur Coker project, which is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2023 and to increase the refinery’s throughput capacity, while also improving turnaround efficiency. • We have also invested to upgrade product value with projects such as the Houston and St. Charles Alkylation Units. • Projects to install cogeneration units at our Wilmington and Pembroke refineries have contributed to resilience, cost control and margin expansion. • Investments in crude logistics such as the Diamond Pipeline, Red River Pipeline and Glass Mountain Pipeline connection have improved access to North American crude and have lowered refinery feedstock costs. • Investments in products logistics such as the Central Texas pipelines and terminals and the Pasadena refined products terminal have extended product supply in higher demand domestic markets while also expanding product export and biofuels blending capabilities. • Investments in international logistics such as the acquisitions of storage facilities in Wales and a fuels distribution business in Peru have expanded our distribution capabilities. • Development of our Mexico wholesale business with a growing and flexible logistics supply system has allowed us to become one of the largest importers of light products into Mexico, driving further margin improvement and market expansion. Letter From Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer LETTER FROM OUR CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER Explore economic low-carbon projects that leverage Valero’s project development and manufacturing expertise. • On a consolidated basis, we have invested more than $5 billion to date in a world-scale low-carbon portfolio of ethanol and renewable diesel production. • These investments have made Valero one of the world’s largest producers of low-carbon transportation fuels. • We continue to deliver long-term value to stockholders with low-carbon fuels investments that meet or exceed our aftertax internal rate of return (“IRR”) threshold, such as our recently announced sustainable aviation fuel (“SAF”) project, which is expected to give the DGD Port Arthur plant the capability to upgrade approximately half of its current 470 million gallons per year production capacity to SAF. • Our previously announced large-scale carbon sequestration project is expected to enable production of low-carbon ethanol at many of our ethanol plants and should uniquely position these assets for additional opportunities such as alcohol-to-jet, in addition to margin uplift on low-carbon intensity ethanol. • In addition, we are advancing the evaluation of other low-carbon projects such as low-carbon hydrogen, cellulosic ethanol, renewable propane and additional renewable naphtha and carbon sequestration projects, and we are supporting the development of a tailpipe CO2 onboard capture system, with the objective of reducing GHG emissions from the use of transportation fuels in internal combustion engines. • These initiatives provide a clear roadmap to achieving our refinery greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions reduction/ displacement targets for 2025 and 2035 while generating an adequate return for our stockholders. Utilize a disciplined capital allocation framework that emphasizes an investment grade credit rating while delivering distinctive financial results and peer-leading returns to stockholders.* • Since 2014, our cash flow generation and approach to capital allocation have enabled us to significantly enhance shareholder value. • Over this time period, we have reduced our share count by almost 30%, increased the dividend per share by over 370% and returned approximately $23.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock purchases. • Over this same time period, our market capitalization has more than doubled, driving a total shareholder return (“TSR”) of 306% since 2014, versus a TSR of 130% for the S&P 500, making Valero the best performing energy company in the S&P 500. * Data in these bullet points is from December 31, 2014 - January 27, 2023. Commitment to our people and our communities. • In 2022, Valero and our employees generously pledged a record $19 million to the United Way across the U.S., which will be distributed to the communities where we work and operate. • Our employees also volunteered more than 100,000 hours last year, from building homes and donating blood, to mentoring students and providing meals for families. • With the generous support of our business partners, more than $22 million was raised at the Valero Texas Open and Benefit for Children in 2022, bringing the all-time tournament total to $209 million, with $205 million raised since Valero became the title sponsor in 2002. The Valero Texas Open has grown to become the number one tournament on the PGA Tour in charitable giving. Thank You We hope these highlights demonstrate our commitment to and execution of our strategy. We welcome continued engagement and dialogue with stockholders and other stakeholders. Thank you for your support and trust.",

We want to help build a better world where every person is free to move and pursue their dreams. We believe that the long-term success of any business depends on how it creates value for its customers, employees, and communities, while also caring for the planet. Our shared challenge now is bringing even greater urgency to protecting the planet, advancing social equity and supporting a just transition to electric vehicles. In 2022, the Ford team reimagined our products, services and the way we work to align with our environmental and social priorities. We announced that we would reorganize our global automotive operations into three distinct business segments: Ford Blue, Ford Model e and Ford Pro. As a result, we are forming deeper customer relationships, creating lifestyle-enhancing technology and pursuing exciting products. Last year we invested in renewable energy, new facilities and upgrades to existing facilities and announced the creation of thousands of jobs. We began the work of bringing electric vehicles to scale. We are committed to creating a carbon-neutral transportation future. To that end, we plan to source 100% carbon-free electricity for our global manufacturing efforts by 2035. Last year, we made the largest renewable energy purchase from a utility in U.S. history. Ford also issued its inaugural Sustainable Financing Report, highlighting how the net proceeds from the company’s first Green Bond are being allocated to support the design and manufacturing of Ford’s electric vehicles. Lastly, we are supporting our suppliers, ensuring they set and meet science-based targets to reduce their carbon footprint, a critical element of our sustainability efforts that include clean air and clean water initiatives. We are also using our purchasing power not only to fuel our business needs but also to protect our customers, communities and the environment. We have invested resources to better understand the origins of our raw materials and ensure they are sourced responsibly. Last year, 3BL Media’s Best Corporate Citizen ranking listed Ford first in the human rights category, and the World Benchmarking Alliance recognized us as the top automotive company in human rights for the second time in a row. And through the work of the Ford Fund, our philanthropic arm, we continue to partner with communities to expand access to resources and opportunities that help move people forward. Ford is undertaking a massive transformation to lead the electric vehicle revolution, and the accomplishments in this report signal our genuine commitment to doing so in a way that is consistent with our values. Around the world, we are planning to invest more than $50 billion from 2022 through 2026 to create a carbon-neutral transportation future. We are on track to reach an annual targeted production run rate of 600,000 electric vehicles globally by the end of 2023, and 2 million by the end of 2026. Ford was the second bestselling electric vehicle brand in the U.S. in 2022. Mustang Mach-E production continues to grow with an order bank in the thousands – two-thirds of customers are new to Ford. F-150 Lightning has been America’s best-selling electric truck 1 since its launch and the ETransit led the electric van segment in 2022 at 73% share in the U.S. We take the long view at Ford, and we are excited and optimistic about the future. We know we are on the road to better. Thank you for your interest in Ford Motor Company, and we invite you to read more about our progress and plans in this report.",

Dear Shareholders:
 
Throughout fiscal 2022, we continued to reduce friction for our customers and improve the interconnected experience. Sales leveraging our digital platforms increased over 7 percent versus prior year, and we continue to see record downloads, traffic, and sales via our mobile app. This growth is attributable to several enhancements, including an improved online experience for our Pro loyalty program, the seamless connectivity we have provided for our military program, and the launch of our new store mode feature, which makes navigating the store and interacting with products much easier. These enhancements translate to less friction for our customers, as they navigate the digital world and connect to the physical world.

We also drove productivity within the four walls of our store through multiple initiatives. Our ""Get Stores Right"", or ""GSR"", space optimization initiative has optimized our selling square footage on a store-by-store basis for hundreds of stores, resulting in a better associate and customer experience.
 

 
Fiscal 2022: Another Year of Growth
Fiscal 2022 was another record year for The Home Depot. We grew our sales by over $6 billion on top of the more than $40 billion of sales growth we delivered over the prior two-year period. Even more impressive is that we achieved these results while successfully navigating a number of challenges, including persistent inflation, ongoing global supply chain disruptions, and a tight labor market.

During fiscal 2022, total sales grew 4.1 percent to
$157.4 billion, compared to fiscal 2021. Fiscal 2022 comparable sales growth was 3.1 percent for the total company and 2.9 percent in the U.S. Our fiscal
2022 net earnings were $17.1 billion, and earnings per diluted share increased 7.5 percent to $16.69.

This performance was enabled by our associates and supplier partners, as well as investments we have made in our people, stores, digital platforms, supply chain, technology, and other strategic priorities.

While change is constant in our business, our strategic priorities remain the same: deliver the best customer experience in home improvement and extend our low­ cost provider position. Our objectives to grow market
 
We are pleased with the continued build out of our enhanced supply chain network, reaching an important milestone in fiscal 2022, as we now have all our appliance delivery volume managed through our Market Delivery Operations. Controlling the appliance delivery experience end-to-end has helped to reduce complexity and drive meaningful improvements in customer satisfaction.


Investing in Our People
While all our investments have strengthened the business and positioned us to grow share and deliver exceptional value over the long term, we believe that the most important investment we can make is in
our people. We know that our associates are our key differentiator, and they are essential in helping us sustain an excellent customer experience. As a result, we recently announced that we will invest approximately
$1 billion in annualized compensation for our frontline, hourly associates beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. We believe this investment will position us favorably in the market, allowing us not only to attract
the most qualified talent, but also retain the exceptional associate base that is already in place. This is just one component of the associate investment story.
 


















 
To provide the best customer experience in home improvement, we must focus on cultivating the best associate experience in retail. This means not only investing in competitive wages and benefits, but also providing tools, training and development
opportunities that make working at The Home Depot an enjoyable and rewarding experience. This year we took steps to better align our store leadership structure to deliver excellent customer service, take care of our people, and build strong relationships.
We created new management positions focused entirely on the customer experience, increasing the number of managers on the floor at any given time and freeing up time for other store leaders to devote to associate training and development. The net result of these actions is an improved customer and associate experience, while also creating new career paths and development opportunities for associates.

We also remain focused on leveraging new tools and technology in stores to reduce complexity for associates and improve customer service. In
fiscal 2022, we upgraded our in-store network and introduced the next generation of in-store mobile devices, known as hdPhones. For the first time ever, every associate on the floor will have an hdPhone in their hands with enhanced communication features, tools, and training capabilities. With the deployment of empowering, productivity-driving apps and other features, these new hdPhones make it easier for associates to serve customers and helps them prioritize tasks more effectively.

In addition to our associates, the tenure and strength of our relationships with our supplier and
 
transportation partners have also been keys to our success. Throughout the last few years, our respective teams have worked tirelessly to flow product to distribution centers and stores as quickly and efficiently as possible. And despite inflation and constrained global supply chain conditions, our partners continue to work collaboratively with us to deliver on our promise
to be the product authority in home improvement by investing to drive innovation and value for our customers.

I could not be more pleased with the resilience and strength that our associates have continued to
demonstrate, and I want to thank them and our supplier partners for their hard work and dedication to serving our customers and communities.

As we look to fiscal 2023, we anticipate continued macroeconomic uncertainty, but believe we have the tools, team, and experience to effectively manage in any environment. We will continue to leverage our distinct competitive advantages to capitalize on compelling
long-term growth opportunities in our space. The investments we have made and will continue to make in differentiated capabilities throughout the business will deliver a value proposition that we believe is unique in home improvement, allowing us to grow faster than the market and deliver shareholder value.

We also led the industry in key segments, gained the most U.S. market share, and were the fastest-growing of any high-volume manufacturer in total U.S. fleet sales. Despite a difficult industry environment, we delivered record financial performance. Our U.S. hourly employees shared in our success, earning record profit sharing of $500 million, bringing the three-year total payout to $1.2 billion. Looking ahead, we expect 2023 will be another strong year for GM, and a breakout year for our Ultium Platform. We are executing a product strategy across our ICE and EV portfolios designed to support strong pricing and grow our market share, especially with all-electric vehicles like the Cadillac LYRIQ and the Chevrolet Silverado EV, Blazer EV, and affordable Equinox EV. We are also accelerating businesses and technologies that will further drive revenue generation and profit growth, like BrightDrop and Cruise. Board Evolution with Purpose and Impact Delivering strong financial results during this period of high investment demonstrates the importance of recruiting strong directors to make sure our Board evolves with our business and remains a competitive advantage. We are executing our strategic Board refreshment and succession plan, which has bolstered the Board’s expertise with new, diverse directors that have deep industry knowledge in software, marketing, and cybersecurity. As we continue our work to refresh the Board, we would like to recognize Carol Stephenson, who is retiring from the Board and not standing for re-election at the Annual Meeting. The Board extends its sincere appreciation for Carol’s exemplary service since 2009 — particularly her insights that have helped enhance our compensation programs by strengthening the link between pay and performance. On the ballot for the first time as director nominees this year are Joanne Crevoiserat, Jon McNeill, and Jan Tighe. Combined with our other director nominees, we believe these additions help create a Board with the right balance of skills, qualifications, and experience to create unprecedented opportunities for GM, drive long-term shareholder value, and execute our vision of a world with zero crashes, zero emissions, and zero congestion. Annual Meeting Preview At the Annual Meeting, we will provide an update on the Company’s transformation and performance, vote on several items related to our business, and shareholders will have the opportunity to ask questions. We encourage you to review this Proxy Statement to learn more about the Board, our governance practices, compensation programs and philosophy, and other important developments and priorities at GM.

23,JPMorgan Chase,Commercial Banks,"293,723",154792,383549,37676,24.3,JPM,"Dear Fellow Shareholders, Across the globe, 2022 was another year of significant challenges: from a terrible war in Ukraine and growing geopolitical tensions — particularly with China — to a politically divided America. Almost all nations felt the effects of global economic uncertainty, including higher energy and food prices, mounting inflation rates and volatile markets, and, of course, COVID-19’s lingering impacts. While all these experiences and associated turmoil have serious ramifications on our company, colleagues, clients and the countries in which we do business, their consequences on the world at large — with the extreme suffering of the Ukrainian people and the potential restructuring of the global order — are far more important. As these events unfold, America remains divided within its borders, and its global leadership role is being challenged outside of its borders. Nevertheless, this is the moment when we should put aside our differences and work with other Western nations to come together in defense of democracy and essential Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 2 freedoms, including free enterprise. During other times of great crisis, we have seen America, in partnership with other countries around the globe, unite for a common cause. This is that moment again, when our country needs to work across public and private sectors to lead while improving American competitiveness — which also means re-establishing the American promise of providing equal access to opportunity for all. JPMorgan Chase, a company that historically has worked across borders and boundaries, will do its part to ensure the global economy is safe and secure. In spite of the unsettling landscape, 2022 was somewhat surprisingly another strong year for JPMorgan Chase, with the firm generating record revenue for the fifth year in a row, as well as setting numerous records in each of our lines of business. We earned revenue in 2022 of $132.3 billion1 and net income of $37.7 billion, with return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) of 18%, reflecting strong underlying performance across our businesses. We also maintained our quarterly common dividend of $1.00 per share and continued to reinforce our fortress balance sheet. We grew market share in several of our businesses and continued to make significant investments in products, people and technology while exercising strict credit discipline. In total, we extended credit and raised capital of $2.4 trillion for our consumer and institutional clients around the world. I remain proud of our company’s resiliency and of what our hundreds of thousands of employees around the world have achieved, collectively and individually. Throughout these challenging past few years, we never stopped doing all the things we should be doing to serve our clients and our communities. Adhering to our basic principles and strategies (see sidebar on Steadfast Principles on page 5) allows us to drive good organic growth and properly manage our capital (including dividends and stock buybacks), as we have 1 Represents managed revenue. 3 consistently demonstrated for decades. Our performance results are shown in the charts on pages 6-12, which illustrate how we have grown our franchises, how we compare with our competitors and how we look at our fortress balance sheet. I invite you to peruse them at your leisure. In addition, I urge you to read the CEO letters in this Annual Report, which will give you more specific details about our businesses and our plans for the future. As you know, we are champions of banking’s essential role in a community — its potential for bringing people together, for enabling companies and individuals to attain their goals, and for being a source of strength in difficult times. As I often remind our employees, the work we do matters and has impact. We help people and institutions finance and achieve their aspirations, lifting up individuals, homeowners, small businesses, larger corporations, schools, hospitals, cities and countries in all regions of the world. 4 STEADFAST PRINCIPLES WORTH REPEATING Looking back on the past two+ decades — starting from my time as CEO of Bank One in 2000 — there is one common theme: our unwavering dedication to help clients, communities and countries throughout the world. It is clear that our financial discipline, constant investment in innovation and ongoing development of our people are what enabled us to achieve this consistency and commitment. In addition, across the firm, we uphold certain steadfast tenets that are worth repeating. First, our work has very real human impact. While JPMorgan Chase stock is owned by large institutions, pension plans, mutual funds and directly by single investors, in almost all cases the ultimate beneficiaries are individuals in our communities. More than 100 million people in the United States own stock; many, in one way or another, own JPMorgan Chase stock. Frequently, these shareholders are veterans, teachers, police officers, firefighters, healthcare workers, retirees or those saving for a home, education or retirement. Often, our employees also bank these shareholders, as well as their families and their companies. Your management team goes to work every day recognizing the enormous responsibility that we have to all of our shareholders. Second, shareholder value can be built only if you maintain a healthy and vibrant company, which means doing a good job of taking care of your customers, employees and communities. Conversely, how can you have a healthy company if you neglect any of these stakeholders? As we have learned over the past few years, there are myriad ways an institution can demonstrate its compassion for its employees and its communities while still upholding shareholder value. this letter. We recognize our strengths and vulnerabilities, and we play our hand as best we can. Sixth, we operate with a very important silent partner — the U.S. government — noting as my friend Warren Buffett points out that his company’s success is predicated upon the extraordinary conditions our country creates. He is right to say to his shareholders that when they see the American flag, they all should say thank you. We should, too. JPMorgan Chase is a healthy and thriving company, and we always want to give back and pay our fair share. We do pay our fair share — and we want it to be spent well and have the greatest impact. To give you an idea of where our taxes and fees go: In the last 10 years, we paid more than $43 billion in federal, state and local taxes in the United States and almost $19 billion in taxes outside of the United States. We also paid the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation over $10 billion so that it has the resources to cover failure in the American banking sector. Our partner — the federal government — also imposes significant regulations upon us, and it is imperative that we meet all legal and regulatory requirements imposed on our company. Seventh and finally, we know the foundation of our success rests with our people. They are the frontline, both individually and as teams, serving our customers and communities, building the technology, making the strategic decisions, managing the risks, determining our investments and driving innovation. However you view the world — its complexity, risks and opportunities — a company’s prosperity requires a great team of people with guts, brains, integrity, enormous capabilities and high standards of professional excellence to ensure its ongoing success. Third, while we don’t run the company worrying about the stock price in the short run, in the long run we consider our stock price a measure of our progress over time. This progress is a function of continual investments in our people, systems and products, in good and bad times, to build our capabilities. These important investments will also drive our company’s future prospects and position it to grow and prosper for decades. Measured by stock performance, our progress is exceptional. For example, whether looking back 10 years or even farther to 2004, when the JPMorgan Chase/Bank One merger took place, we have significantly outperformed the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and the Standard & Poor’s Financials Index. Fourth, we are united behind basic principles and strategies (you can see the How We Do Business principles on our website) that have helped build this company and made it thrive — from maintaining a fortress balance sheet, constantly investing and nurturing talent to fully satisfying regulators, continually improving risk, governance and controls, and serving customers and clients while lifting up communities worldwide. This philosophy is embedded in our company culture and influences nearly every role in the firm. Fifth, we strive to build enduring businesses, which rely on and benefit from one another, but we are not a conglomerate. This structure helps generate our superior returns. Nonetheless, despite our best efforts, the walls that protect this company are not particularly high — and we face extraordinary competition. I have written about this reality extensively in the past and cover it again in",
24,Kroger,Food and Drug Stores,"430,000",148258,35421,2244,1.5,KR,"Dear Fellow Shareholders, One of the things I love about food retail is that customers are always evolving. As tastes and needs continually shift, accommodating those shifts with agility earn us the privilege of continuing to serve our customers. This is what makes our industry so exciting. The ways customers shop for food is ever evolving and always changing. Customers used to shop once a week, checking off items from handwritten lists. Today, our customers manage their groceries with a mix of in-person and online shopping, rely on digital technologies to make lists and track spending, and shop for more ready-made meal solutions. Outside our stores, we know customers spend approximately half of their food budgets at restaurants. What hasn’t changed is our passion to deliver fresh, affordable food to the communities we serve and inspire our customers to discover their love for food. Our business model is built around offering fresh products at competitive prices with no compromise on quality, selection, and convenience. This is a timetested approach in any operating environment, and we remain committed to it into the future. Every day, we provide our customers with lower prices on the foods they love and more choices to meet their needs and wants. Our passion for our customers, associates and communities is also on display in our willingness to take on difficult challenges and see them through. We see it in the way our store and supply chain teams respond to natural disasters, always the first to help our communities. We see it in the way our associates worked with the White House, governors, and mayors to ensure America had access to fresh, affordable food during the pandemic. And we see it in our willingness to address one of our food systems most intractable challenges – that more than 40% of the food produced goes to waste each year while one in eight Americans struggle with hunger – through our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste impact plan. Kroger has the fortitude to take on these challenges because we know that when we take care of our customers, associates and communities, our shareholders will benefit. We continue delivering value for our shareholders. On a three-year basis, Kroger’s adjusted net earnings per diluted share has grown at a compounded annual growth rate of 24.5% which has helped support a total shareholder return of 78.2% over the same period. This incredible outcome is the result of our dedicated and thriving associates delivering a full, fresh and friendly experience for more than 11 million customers every day. It’s no wonder Kroger was recently included in a list of America’s Most Trustworthy Companies. From our manufacturing facilities and fulfillment centers to our store and office teams, we appreciate everything our associates do to embody Our Purpose: To Feed the Human Spirit. Our associates are driving consistent execution of our go-to-market strategy in every interaction, everyday positioning the company for sustainable, long-term growth. Kroger is building momentum and has the people, the plan, and the operational discipline to win today and in the future. * * * Update on proposed merger with Albertsons Co. In October 2022, we announced our definitive merger agreement with Albertsons Companies, Inc. We are incredibly impressed with the Albertsons team and their commitment to their associates, culture, customers, and communities. Lower prices. More Choices. We believe bringing our highly complementary organizations together will provide customers with lower prices and more choices. Our proposed merger will mean more value for our customers, with lower prices and more food choices to discover. And we will begin on day one post-close, with $500 million already committed to bringing down prices. Empower our associates’ success Our associates are responsible for our success, and we are committed to investing in theirs. The proposed combination will secure the long-term future of union jobs while creating a more competitive alternative to larger, non-union retailers. We have already committed $1 billion to continue raising associate wages and comprehensive, industry-leading benefits. It is vital that we support our associates as they explore what their individual career paths will be. So many of our associates come to Kroger to experience their first job. In 2022, approximately 20% of our new hires were 18 years old or younger. It is amazing that Kroger introduces so many young people to a fulfilling career in the grocery industry. We demonstrate how our associates can choose from many different paths and how a foundation in amazing customer service supports associates’ long-term goals, no matter where associates choose to build their careers. At Kroger, associates get to help families discover healthier answers to the question, “what’s for dinner tonight;” create technology that makes customers’ shopping trips simpler; make healthcare more accessible for their neighbors – and even dream up a job that has yet to be created. The career opportunities are truly endless. Build healthier communities free of hunger The proposed merger will also allow our organization to invest in our communities in ways we simply cannot do on our own. I am so proud of what we have accomplished in our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste work and am impressed by the Albertsons team’s commitment to supporting their communities as outlined in their Recipe for Change plan. We know that when families eat together, it supports their children’s success across all aspects of their lives. I cannot wait to see how our combined efforts will connect people with the meals they need to thrive. We look forward to continue working cooperatively with regulators and remain on track for a projected closure of the merger in early 2024. 2022 in Review As the pandemic continued to fade and inflation caused ongoing economic uncertainty, our associates showed up for our customers. Last year, Kroger associates did everything we could to minimize the impact of inflation and help stretch tight food budgets so families could access fresh, affordable food, with zero compromise on convenience or selection. Our Leading with Fresh and Accelerating with Digital strategy and key focus areas of Fresh, Our Brands, seamless and personalization give us the flexibility to navigate a changing operating environment – all while providing value to our customers and our associates. We will continue to consider a five- to ten-year time horizon as we make key decisions. During the year, we:  Achieved positive identical sales without fuel of 5.6%  Increased associate wages, resulting in an average hourly wage of $18 and rate of more than $23 with comprehensive benefits  Exceeded $1 billion in cost savings for the fifth consecutive year  Announced 14 additional Kroger Delivery locations across the U.S. The subsequent sections will highlight progress we made across our business in 2022 and ways we intend to continue building on our momentum moving forward. Leading with Fresh For us, Fresh for EveryoneTM is more than a brand promise. It’s a commitment to bringing fresh, affordable foods to more people in more neighborhoods. Fresh foods are central to families living healthy, thriving lives. And our customers prioritize fresh when they shop with Kroger – with more than more than 90% of customers purchasing fresh foods. Many companies claim they are focused on fresh – we have demonstrated success in creating fresher shopping experiences, and our customers are rewarding us for it. In the last year, we continued to put our focus on fresh, both with our in-store and e-commerce experiences. The End-to-End Fresh initiative is at the center of how we are changing the way we bring fresh to life in our stores. Today, we have more than 1,400 stores implementing this initiative in their produce departments, driving higher produce and overall store sales. We look forward to exploring how we can expand this work in other fresh departments in 2023 and beyond. We are also working closely with our technology and supply chain teams to understand ways we can add days of freshness to our products. From optimizing delivery routes to simplifying associate tasks, we want to ensure our customers can buy food at its peak of freshness and trust those items will remain fresh in their homes. Freshness is also important when we think about innovation in Our Brands. In 2022, we launched a simplified opening-price-point brand known as Smart Way™. This new concept is easily identifiable for customers who want to stretch their budgets. It joins Kroger’s carefully curated, extensive Our Brands portfolio, which includes the company’s namesake Kroger brand, Simple Truth®, Private Selection®, Home Chef® and Heritage Farm®, among others. In addition to the Smart Way brand introduction, we launched more than 680 new, unique Our Brands products last year. We engage with food trends throughout the year to understand what our customers are craving and ensure we have those items on our shelves. We aim to bring every customer the high-quality, affordable products they love – from pantry staples and fresh foods to ready-to-heat, restaurant-quality meals. Accelerating with Digital We continue to invest in our seamless ecosystem – bringing our customers the products they love when and where they want them. We see customers shift the ways they interact with us based on their individual needs, which aligns with our vision of a truly seamless shopping experience. Our goal remains to be there for our customers – however they need us in a particular moment. When it fits their day’s plans, customers may choose to shop in our stores. Sometimes, they find a Kroger Delivery order easier during a busy weekend. Or when nothing looks good in the refrigerator or the last paper towel comes off the roll, we’re here with Kroger Delivery Now, delivering in as little as 30 minutes. We remain well-positioned to achieve double-digit digital growth in the next three years. Our brick-and-mortar stores and automated fulfillment centers work together to ensure our customers have access to the fresh foods and pantry staples they want when they need them most. Our efforts to bring a truly personalized shopping experience to life are creating value for our customers. We serve the right promotions at the right time, directly to the customers who would be most interested in the offer. From providing suggestions to start a basket to offering a new item, we are providing customers real value. In 2022 alone, customers saved $1.4 billion through a combination of paper and digital coupons. Last year, we also launched Boost by Kroger, the retail industry’s most-affordable membership program. We are already exceeding internal expectations in both incremental engagement and household spend. We look forward to evolving our membership program to appeal to more customers and create additional value. The Accelerating with Digital piece of our strategy continues to drive our profit flywheel. We are improving margins by reducing digital cost-to-serve, all while growing our alternative profit streams. Investing in Our Associates Our associates are at the heart of everything we do. I am always impressed at the ways they create memorable food moments for our customers every day. I regularly think back to my time working in a Kroger store when I began my career more than 40 years ago. I learned how to run a successful store, how to create real community with my customers and coworkers, and how important our stores are to the neighborhoods they serve. Kroger provides opportunities for people seeking their first job, a new beginning, or a new challenge to discover a fulfilling career path. And we continue to invest in our associates. Earlier this year we committed nearly $800 million to raise wages and benefits, create new training opportunities, and improve healthcare options in 2023. This investment builds on our $1.9 billion in incremental investments in wages and comprehensive benefits Kroger has made since 2018. As a result, we raised our average hourly rate to $18, or $23.50 an hour with comprehensive benefits. We understand we must support our associates’ holistic well-being. To accomplish this goal, Kroger creates programs that power our associates’ growth, including a world-class educational benefit program offering associates up to $21,000 toward continuing education opportunities – whatever that may mean to our associates. In 2022 alone, more than 5,000 people engaged with this program. We provide affordable, accessible healthcare options, which includes free counseling. Also in 2022, we introduced a first-of-itskind free financial coaching services to all our hourly associates. We remain committed to helping our associates thrive in their careers and at home, ensuring Kroger remains an employer of choice. Environmental Sustainability and Social Impact Kroger is committed to responsible sourcing practices, respecting human rights, and advancing animal welfare. Our comprehensive programs hold our suppliers accountable to meet our high standards and support our continual improvement. We rely on deep knowledge from our category sourcing leaders, data insights and input from our investors, industry groups, NGOs, and subject-matter experts. In 2022, we published our greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction goal roadmap. We are diligently working to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from our operations by 30% by 2030 against a 2018 baseline. This goal was developed using climate science, supporting a well-below 2ºC climate scenario according to the absolute contraction method. Kroger made considerable progress against our Framework for Action: Diversity, Equity & Inclusion plan. Launched in 2020, this action plan is accelerating change across the entire company. Since its introduction, we successfully provided unconscious bias training to all leaders and nearly half a million associates. We are working with 53 Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and institutions serving Hispanic, Asian American and Pacific Islander, and Native American students. And we are taking strong steps to achieve our goal of increasing our spend with diverse suppliers to $10 billion annually by 2030. We are growing the many ways we participate in our communities – both big and small. In 2022, we celebrated the fifth anniversary of our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste impact plan. Since its inception, we directed more than $1.65 billion in food and funds to help end hunger, which includes more than 2.3 billion meals. We remain on track to donate 3 billion meals to our neighbors by 2025. One accomplishment I am so proud of is our stores’ work to achieve 100% execution of our food rescue program in participating Kroger stores. Flawless execution is an ideal for which we always strive. It is inspirational to see the way our store teams embrace our mission of providing healthy food to their communities. Looking to the Future I am optimistic for what 2023 and beyond will mean for Kroger, our customers, our associates, and our communities. We are committed to providing the freshest food to our customers, with zero compromise on value, convenience, or selection. We are investing in the business to continuously optimize our approach to freshness – and our customers are taking notice. Our teams are always looking for new opportunities to bring fresh Our Brands items to our customers, both capitalizing on food trends and creating experiences that can only come from Kroger. Customers continue to expect the convenience our digital experience offers. We are working toward innovative ways to ensure grocery shopping fits easily into our customers’ days – whether they are looking for a need-it-now item, a weekly stock-up shop, or the perfect ingredient to make a special meal more memorable. And we do more than make it convenient – we make the shopping experience personal. We know our customers, and we earn their trust daily by providing engaging offers on the foods they love. And our amazing associates bring it all to life. In addition to creating a full, fresh, and friendly shopping experience for every customer, every time, our associates are committed to making their communities a better place to live. This year, we are recognizing 50 outstanding associates who raised significant funds for our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Foundation. These dollars support our nonprofit partners across America who are working to create communities free from hunger and waste. Congratulations to each of these “Zero Heroes” for making measurable change for your neighbors. I would like to thank our customers, associates, and shareholders for your ongoing support for Kroger. I look forward to everything we will do together in the year ahead. With gratitude,",

As a leader in government-sponsored healthcare, Centene is uniquely positioned to address the environmental, social, and health barriers that impact our country’s most vulnerable populations. Removing those barriers and transforming the community’s whole health continues to be an essential element of how we care for our members and their communities. In fact, since its founding and long before social determinants of health (SDoH) was a widely recognized issue, Centene understood the impact that factors such as education, gainful employment, and food security could have on an individual’s health and well-being. This is why Centene remains committed to addressing SDoH barriers and advancing health equity, including through community investments to strengthen initiatives focused on health care access, education, and social services for our members. We believe that our local approach enables us to provide accessible, highquality, culturally sensitive healthcare coverage to our communities. We further invest in our communities’ future by continuing to build the workforce needed to best serve our members, focusing on diversity of talent, community impact, supplier diversity, and stakeholder collaboration. Our transition to a hybrid workforce with the majority of our team members working remotely and taking advantage of our talent hubs has reduced our ofce footprint and energy usage, while maintaining our local approach to live, work, and engage in the communities we serve. In 2022, Centene also made signifcant enhancements to the Company’s governance structure to ensure we have the right perspectives and processes to drive our long-term strategy. Centene remains a mission-driven, solutions-oriented partner committed to addressing some of the world’s most complex and systemic issues.

Good governance is an essential element of our long-term success, and we believe that good governance starts with an independent, effective and diverse Board. We believe we are more likely to achieve sustainable growth in shareholder value when our Board has the right mix of skills, expertise and tenure. To that end, the Corporate Governance and Policy Committee is strategic and purposeful in its approach to refreshment and succession planning, carefully considering important factors including skills and experience, diversity, age and tenure, board size and board dynamics. Verizon’s world-class network and purpose-driven, resilient culture have allowed our team to deliver in the way people have come to expect of us, even in unprecedented, challenging times. Each Verizon Director has extensive and relevant leadership experience, including current or prior service as a senior executive of a major corporation or a comparable position in government, for example, as well as significant experience with strategy. This experience is highlighted in the Director biographies on pages 4-9 of the proxy statement. When we nominate candidates to be a Verizon Director, we choose people who possess the personal qualities to make an active contribution to Board deliberations. We especially value interpersonal and communication skills, willingness to ask the difficult questions, a constant desire to learn and, of course, the highest ethical standards. Our Corporate Governance and Policy Committee regularly evaluates the contribution of each of our Directors to our Board, including their availability to undertake the duties of Board and committee membership, their meeting attendance, their independence, and whether a Director’s skills and expertise continue to align with Verizon’s long-term business strategy. We look forward to continuing our success in building the Board in 2023. Sincerely,",

Fiscal year 2022 marked the first year of our transformation to a consumer-centric healthcare company, and we are very pleased with the major progress we’ve made.

29,Comcast,Telecommunications,"186,000",121427,159831,5370,4.4,CMCSA,"Dear Fellow Shareholders, It has been nearly 60 years since Comcast was founded – and 2022 was our most successful year yet. Over the past six decades, we have helped shape technological transformations that have revolutionized the way we live and work. Today, we are at another inflection point, as stunning new applications and capabilities change the world at an astonishing pace. While we can’t perfectly predict what this next wave of invention will bring, one thing is certain: Comcast is uniquely positioned to meet the moment. From the connectivity and platforms we provide, to the content and experiences we create, our businesses are poised to help usher in this new era of media and technology. The backbone of a hyperconnected future is a network that is fast, reliable, efficient, and smart. In 2022, we saw demand for both speed and data skyrocket. Nearly one billion devices connected to the Comcast network – up 12x since 2018 – and approximately one-third of our more than 30 million customers have gigabit or higher service. Five years from now, those numbers will expand exponentially as streaming video, 4K gaming, augmented reality, and connected health become even more central to our daily lives. Our evolution to 10G and a virtual, software-based network – infused with intuitive AI capabilities – will equip us to power the incredible applications yet to be fully imagined. Our extensive mobile and broadband operations in the U.S. and Europe, and the impressive engine that is Comcast Business, are producing fantastic results with significant runway ahead. In the U.K., Sky Mobile is the fastest-growing mobile provider with three million lines and Sky Broadband is now the #2 provider with more than six million subscribers. As entertainment evolves so do the platforms that deliver it, and our global engineering organization is building the software, hardware, and intelligence that are redefining how we consume content. Comcast’s entertainment operating system and award-winning voice remote are now the industry gold standards. Our products are in tens of millions of customers’ homes and will soon be enjoyed around the world and in every major U.S. city through our recently announced joint venture with Charter. We are just beginning to realize the full potential of our proprietary global technology platform, and later this year we’ll launch a new user interface for Sky Glass, X1, Flex, Xumo, and our international partners. At NBCUniversal, we continue to bring extraordinary content to streaming, television, and theater audiences alike. In 2022, we had great success at the global box office with hits like Jurassic World Dominion and Minions, and our studios collected an impressive 15 Academy Award nominations. These films, along with world-class sporting events, new originals, and beloved shows from NBC and Bravo, fueled a remarkable year for streaming at the company. Peacock more than doubled its number of paying subscribers to over 20 million and became the most downloaded streaming app of 2022 in the United States. Meanwhile, we have excellent momentum at Theme Parks. We broke previous attendance and financial records and continued to invest in this wonderful business that brings delightful experiences to millions. Super Nintendo World Hollywood will open later this month, and with cutting-edge AR, guests will be able to immerse themselves in interactive gaming like never before. We will further expand our portfolio with Epic Universe in Orlando – set to open in 2025 – and exciting new park concepts in Nevada and Texas. Across our thriving businesses, we have a roadmap for investing in growth and the resources and leadership to make it happen. We returned more capital to shareholders in 2022 than ever, and our healthy balance sheet provides an exceptionally strong foundation upon which we can build. Most importantly, we have a global team of talented creators and innovators who are passionate about the work we do and energized by the dynamic future that lies ahead. Whether we’re imagining an exhilarating theme park ride for guests, a more intelligent broadband network for customers, or delivering critical news coverage and captivating content to audiences, we are humbled by the central role we play in the lives of millions. True to our values, we will always seek new ways to make a meaningful difference, from advancing digital equity and economic mobility through Project UP, to fostering a cleaner environment through our Carbon Neutral commitment. Together, we look forward to once again helping to reimagine what’s next in technology and entertainment, and to making the world a better place for our customers and communities. It is an honor to help lead this organization.",
30,AT&T,Telecommunications,"160,700",120741,137250,-8524,-7.1,T,"To our shareholders 2022 was a year of major change for AT&T, and we are proud to have ended the year in a stronger position. The realities of our industry, changing consumer expectations and an evolving macroeconomic environment dictated our need for a simplified operating model and sharp execution. That’s why we made the structural moves we did to reposition our company, including successfully completing the separation of WarnerMedia. We have confidence there is a bright future for an AT&T that delivers the best in connectivity. Connectivity is ingrained in our legacy going back nearly 150 years. We have the assets, talent and experience to connect people to greater possibility with simplicity, expertise and inspiration. In 2022, we worked to fulfill this purpose in 3 ways: 1. We grew customer relationships at a near record-setting pace, taking full advantage of all-time-high levels of demand for strong, reliable connectivity. 2. We were effective and efficient in our operations, reaching more than $5 billion of our 3-year, $6 billion-plus run-rate cost transformation target. 3. Our deliberate capital allocation strategy enabled us to invest in 5G and fiber at historic levels, reduce our net debt by about $24 billion and set up a structure we believe will drive better returns for you, our shareholders.1 This includes continuing to provide an attractive dividend. Consistency in operational excellence Describing our go-to-market strategy is as simple as the strategy itself. Be consistent with our offers to our customers, and make it easy for them to do business with us. Wireless In U.S. wireless, we attracted nearly 2.9 million postpaid phone net additions in 2022, marking our second-best annual results in more than a decade, behind only 2021. We also grew wireless service revenues by more than 5% year over year, representing a multi-year high. And we did this while continuing to concentrate on profitability, increasing wireless EBITDA by nearly 4% and achieving our most profitable year on record. 2 We are also a leader in the Internet of Things (IoT). We added more than 12 million connected devices in 2022, becoming the first U.S. carrier to exceed 100 million connected devices. John Stankey Chief Executive Officer 2 AT&T Inc. 2022 Annual Report Our wireless momentum was a direct result of our simplified value proposition, lower acquisition costs, distribution efficiencies and our ability to meet customers on their terms. The strength of our wireless network played a large role in our success, with our recent spectrum investments performing even better than expected. In fact, we were efficient enough with our deployment of mid-band 5G spectrum that we reached more than 150 million people, more than double our original year-end coverage target. And we expect to hit 200 million people by the end of 2023. As a result, our already consistent download speeds increased materially, as recently recognized in the Root Metrics second-half 2022 results. This increased speed provided another significant benefit to our customers. Our wireless network is also the heart of FirstNet®, public safety's dedicated, nationwide communications platform. The AT&T and FirstNet networks cover more than 99% of the population today,3 and FirstNet covers more first responders than any other network in America.4 It’s an honor to serve and support them with prioritized connectivity and capacity plus dedicated spectrum. We ended the year with about 4.4 million FirstNet connections across more than 24,000 agencies. Fiber We delivered strong full-year results in AT&T Fiber® as well. Fiber is a durable, sustainable technology that connects people and businesses with each other and to the world. Fiber investments have a multi-decade lifespan, and we’re investing heavily to build out our network. We believe that AT&T offers the best wired internet available. Quite simply, where we build fiber, we win. 2022 marked our fifth straight year with 1 million or more net additions, raising our AT&T Fiber subscriber base to more than 7 million. We led the industry in bringing fiber to homes5 and closed the year with the ability to serve more than 19 million consumer locations. We also have the ability to serve more than 3 million business locations. We are on track to reach our previously announced goal of 30 million-plus total locations, including consumer and business, by the end of 2025. Our recently announced agreement to form a joint venture with BlackRock Alternatives — Gigapower — is an innovative new business model we are testing to dramatically increase the pace of fiber installation outside of our traditional wireline markets. We believe agile ventures like this open up new possibilities to connect underserved markets with fiber and can compete more effectively for the chance to co-invest with the U.S. government on our shared objectives of a better, connected America. AT&T has the ability to serve more than 22 million consumer and business locations with fiber. 3 These results illustrate our approach has delivered, and while we’ll remain agile as the industry and economy shift, we’re confident in our ability to continue executing at a high level. Corporate responsibility This drive to connect people to greater possibility includes doing our part to create a more connected society and provide underserved communities with the resources they need for education, employment, health care and economic opportunity. Despite the growing availability of high-quality connectivity, one-fifth of the U.S. population is still impacted by the digital divide. 6 We’re passionate about addressing this issue because our country has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to close the broadband gap. Achieving this will give more Americans better opportunities to further their education and access online training to develop workforce skills, all of which helps foster greater economic equity. That’s why we made a 3-year, $2 billion commitment in 2021 to help bridge the digital divide. With this commitment and AT&T’s technology platforms for 5G and fiber deployment that are affordable, sustainable and durable, we have the expertise and scale to make a long-term difference. We’re working to address 3 key components to the digital divide: 1. Access. This primarily impacts areas of the country where deployment can be difficult or slow, but it’s starting to pick up thanks to the more than $48 billion allocated by Congress and the Biden administration to expand broadband infrastructure. Decisions on where to invest in that infrastructure have largely been vested in states, tribal governments and municipalities, and we’re working diligently to find the right opportunities for publicprivate partnerships that enable AT&T to help fund, build and maintain these networks. 2. Affordability. AT&T is a voluntary participant in the FCC’s Affordable Connectivity Program that subsidizes the cost of wireless or internet service for eligible households. When paired with our low-cost Access from AT&T offering, qualified customers can receive internet speeds up to 100 Mbps for free. 3. Adoption. We’re providing communities, students and parents with free digital literacy, online safety and digital learning tools so they understand and feel comfortable with connectivity and can get the most out of their internet connections. These include our Connected Learning Centers housed within local community organizations. The centers provide students and families with computers, high-speed internet access and digital learning and literacy resources. We have 20 of these centers today and plan to reach 50 total locations by 2024. We have a oncein-a-generation opportunity to close the broadband gap. 4 AT&T Inc. 2022 Annual Report Sincerely, John Stankey Chief Executive Officer, AT&T Inc. February 13, 2023 Finally, AT&T is taking action to address climate change in ways relevant to our business and to prepare for its impacts on our operations, customers and communities. We’ve set meaningful goals for 2035, including to be carbon neutral across our global operations. We’ll also help our business customers save a gigaton of greenhouse gas emissions through AT&T connectivity solutions. We’re currently using cutting-edge climate projections to build a more climate resilient network, and we’re sharing the modeled data publicly to help communities better prepare for extreme weather events. Thank you AT&T’s resilience and strong performance are attributable to the perseverance of the people we have guiding and operating the business and serving our customers every day.

Your deep expertise across the entire business serves and delights everyone from consumers to business customers to our government partners.

The strength of our diversity, equity and inclusion practices also informs how we, as a company, approach the big social issues facing us today. We start with you in mind as we support public policies that foster growth in our business and help you, your families, neighbors and friends to achieve your greatest possibilities. To our customers: You’re the reason we’re here. We’re committed to delivering a more connected future — one full of possibility — that improves your lives for the better. Thank you for the trust you place in us. In return, we work tirelessly to serve you and give our best every day. And to our shareholders: Thank you for your confidence in AT&T.

We are now reaching toward the goals of net zero emissions across our value chain and becoming water positive throughout our operations, aiming to achieve both of these milestones in 2030. Meta’s net zero in 2030 goal focuses on embedding sustainability into everything we do, whether designing products, commuting, selecting construction materials or working with suppliers to set their own net zero targets. For example, through our Net Zero program, we work closely with suppliers to determine their Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, set reduction targets and promote strategic action. We know that reaching net zero emissions across our value chain will not be an easy task. Right now, our Scope 3 emissions are increasing and will continue to do so as we work to support the global demand for the services we provide. We see our role as protecting people and the planet through responsible operations — minimizing our emissions and the energy and water used to power our data centers that enable users to access our products and the workplaces where those products are built and managed — while protecting workers and the environment in our supply chain. Within our global footprint, our data centers generate the highest percentage of our energy use, water use and GHG emissions, which is why increasing their efficiency is critical in maintaining net zero operations and striving for a net zero value chain. Our approach to data center sustainability focuses on using less — less energy, water, unnecessary infrastructure, and waste — and building the most efficient buildings we can. We further reduce our environmental impact through renewable energy, water stewardship, circularity, and low-carbon alternatives. Operating sustainable data centers is foundational to our sustainability strategy. Our strategy is anchored by three components — how we operate, what we create and how we collaborate. Our size and global reach give us the opportunity — and the responsibility — to drive sustainable change across our industry. Our work to reduce emissions will drive market availability for other companies to do the same. Our challenge, to transform our ambition into rapid decarbonization, extends beyond our data centers and offices, including emissions from the server components our suppliers manufacture to our employees’ commutes. We do not have all of the answers yet, but we commit to continuing to share our journey with you through this annual report.

Deliver what guests want and need today while anticipating where they’re headed tomorrow. Invest vigorously in the team, strategy and capabilities to stay in step with guests. Grow steadily. Grow profitably. And harvest the benefits of increasing scale to build on these efforts perpetually. This discipline and alignment have produced continuous growth through a wide range of business environments, with ample opportunity still ahead of us. But not all of our recent growth has been steady. In the core pandemic years of 2020 and 2021, we spiked to never-before-seen growth rates that stretched our model to new limits. Our team was able to support that unexpected growth because the fundamentals were in place, and we carefully stewarded capital, capabilities and above all our connection to guests in an extraordinary moment for our company. Even in 2022, with constrained consumer demand and massive shifts in buying behaviors, we grew by more than $3 billion. Today, Target is more than $30 billion bigger than it was in 2019. Consistently trusted A significant part of this growth has been driven by traffic. Last year’s traffic gain of 2.1% marked the sixth straight year of growth in this key metric. It demonstrates that even as guests’ day-to-day needs fluctuate—often rapidly and dramatically—they’re turning to Target more and more for everything they want and need. That speaks to the trust and loyalty we’re continuously building with our guests. Regardless of era or environment, our team takes a lot of pride in being able to flex into the merchandise categories and channels that are most relevant to guests—and then being able to flex again when things change. For instance, last year, comp sales in frequency categories like food & beverage, essentials and beauty grew quickly as guests on tighter budgets prioritized basics. But while navigating high inflation and rapidly rising interest rates, guests still looked to us for their discretionary choices, purchasing nearly $55 billion in apparel, home and hardlines in 2022. This flexibility and focus on guests consistently delivers growth— whether in the pre-pandemic years of 2017–2019, or in the peak of the pandemic, or in this still-unfolding transitional timeframe that we’re living and leading through. Anchoring to new excellence The model we laid out in 2019, before the pandemic, was to grow total revenue steadily in the mid-single digits, and to translate that into accelerated growth in operating income and earnings per share. In broad strokes, after we recover from the unique and significant profit headwinds we faced in 2022, we believe that this remains the right trajectory for Target in the long term. However, a couple of variables in the model have changed significantly for the better. First, the revenue gains we anticipate in the years ahead will be built on a base of nearly $110 billion, not the $78 billion that served as our starting mark in 2019. Second, with the new scale of our business and the continuing maturation of capabilities that barely existed three years ago, we see tremendous opportunities to streamline and simplify how we run Target. We expect these advances in efficiency to result in $2 to $3 billion in savings in the years ahead, providing additional fuel for future growth. But more importantly, they’ll make it easier for our team to focus on the fundamentals of delivering a great experience for more guests across more trips as we continue to grow. More of what works Our team moved into this year with a lot of energy, a unified commitment to guests and growth and a companywide focus on retail fundamentals and efficiency. In 2023, we’ll continue to: • Support our team and lean into our culture, knowing they’re at the heart of our overall success. • Invest in our store-remodel and expansion plans, in our supply chain and in digital and same-day fulfillment through our stores-as-hubs model. • Deliver a steady cadence of newness in owned and national brands across our multi-category assortment. • Bring the magic of Tar-zhay to life, day in and day out, while delivering affordable joy for our guests. While the facets of our strategy remain consistent, we’re accelerating key growth drivers this year. Shareholders will see particular emphasis on: digital growth, our loyalty ecosystem, our media company Roundel and our enterprise sustainability strategy, Target Forward. We recognize that we’re moving through an unpredictable consumer and economic landscape, with plenty of near-term challenges on the horizon. But we’re optimistic about what we can deliver as a team. We believe we’ll be able to flex up the categories and the value proposition that are most relevant to our guests right now, while inspiring guests with newness and staying focused on gaining share across our portfolio to build on our multiyear growth trajectory. We’re also realistic about how 2023 will keep challenging us to be agile, resilient and responsive as we sustain our steady record of taking care of our guests, our team, our communities and our shareholders. I appreciate your continued support and look forward to the value we’ll create this year",

The year started strong, but ongoing disruptions in geo-politics and trade, inflation, rising interest rates, and slowing economies took a toll as the year progressed. Customers became more cautious, and spending slowed. Through it all, I’m proud of how our team delivered. We remained focused on our customers and driving the innovation that matters to them. We also remained focused on delivering results for all our stakeholders. Financial Performance and Capital Allocation: • Record full-year revenue of $102.3 billion, up 1% • Record full-year operating income of $5.8 billion, up 24% • Returned $3.8 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends • Raised our annual dividend by 12% from $1.32 to $1.48 per share, reflecting confidence in generating strong cash flow over time Infrastructure Solutions Group: When it comes to digital transformation, customers cannot afford to sit on the sidelines. Innovations in edge computing and Generative AI are increasing that sense of urgency. From growth and productivity to customer relations to R&D, technology is at the heart of our customers’ greatest opportunities. Our infrastructure solutions business has not been immune to the slowdown, but overall, infrastructure spending has proven more resilient in this cycle. • Record revenue of $38.4 billion, up 12% • Record operating income of $5 billion, up 35% • Record revenue in both Storage and Servers & Networking. Client Solutions Group: Coming off the massive investments in PCs and peripherals during the pandemic, there has been a significant pause in spending. Individuals and businesses are digesting all this new capability and assessing their needs going forward. As businesses continue welcoming people back to the office, they have to compete with what has become a really great user experience at home. We expect that will be a catalyst for growth later this year. We are concentrating on the most profitable segments. We are a structural share gainer. And we expect to continue to outperform the industry. • Revenue of $58.2 billion, down 5% • Operating income of $3.8 billion, down 12% Innovation: Through it all, we kept an unwavering focus on delivering innovation. In fact, FY23 may have been the greatest year for innovation in Dell history. Our innovation agenda focuses on our customers biggest opportunities to drive their organizations forward with Future of Work, Artificial Intelligence, Multicloud, and Edge. And we are the only one looking at these issues from end-to end, making the entire environment both secure and sustainable. • 120 new products and solutions • 2,445 U.S. patents granted in calendar-year 2022 A Bright Future Technology innovation is the catalyst to realize our greatest opportunities as a global society.

35,Archer Daniels Midland,Food Production,"41,181",101556,43530,4340,4.3,ADM,"Dear Stockholders, 2022 was an important year for ADM. We celebrated our 120th anniversary with outstanding financial results, demonstrating once again how our unparalleled global footprint, combined with our best-in-class team, power our performance even in dynamic market conditions. We advanced key strategic initiatives across our Productivity and Innovation pillars, continuing to build a better company and position our portfolio for future growth. And importantly, we lived our purpose and demonstrated the power of our culture by supporting the global food system in a time of stress, and standing up to assist our colleagues and the people of Ukraine. Our Productivity work continued to help us enhance efficiencies and achieve a record four-quarter adjusted average ROIC of 13.6%. We launched a new Billion Dollar Challenge in 2022: Around the globe, thousands of colleagues stepped up to identify opportunities to monetize assets and optimize working capital, exceeding our goals by unlocking more than $1.6 billion in cash by the end of the year. We completed a modernization of our corn processing facility in Marshall, Minnesota, and are now using that successful project as a model for a wider effort to install enhanced automation, more sophisticated control systems, and the increased use of analytics at production facilities worldwide. And we continued the expansion of our 1ADM business transformation, which is enabling us to improve our processes and expand capabilities in areas ranging from indirect procurement, to go-to-market strategies, to grain merchandising. In Innovation, we continued in 2022 to position our company to meet demand in large, fastgrowing categories, powered by the enduring trends of food security, health and well-being, and sustainability. For example, we advanced several initiatives relating to enhancing our ability to meet growing demand for plant-based proteins: We announced a capacity expansion in Decatur, Illinois, and completed one in Serbia; we invested to add non-GMO soybean processing at our facility in Mainz, Germany; we entered into a partnership with Benson Hill to scale ultra-high protein soy for food; and we began construction on our Decatur Nutrition Protein Solutions Center. We made significant strides to decarbonize our value chain in order to be the partner of choice in low-carbon intensity feedstocks: We enrolled 1.2 million acres in regenerative agriculture programs, continued to focus on advancing our Strive 35 goals across our production footprint, and continued to propel our initiatives to connect and expand our carbon capture and storage capabilities. This work is helping us offer new, low-carbon intensity solutions for customers across our portfolio, exemplified by our PepsiCo agreement, our lactic acid and polylactic acid joint ventures with LG Chem, our North Dakota project to supply feedstocks for renewable diesel, and the continued growth of our BioSolutions business. “We made significant strides to decarbonize our value chain in order to be the partner of choice in low-carbon intensity feedstocks.” Juan Luciano “We were proud to be recognized multiple times for our work across the ESG spectrum ...” Juan Luciano The critical third pillar of our strategy is Culture. Our team in 2022 continued to demonstrate the very best of ADM. In a volatile environment that was impacted by extreme weather, COVID shutdowns in China, and significant supply chain disruptions, our colleagues around the globe leveraged our irreplicable global asset footprint, our best-in-class execution, and our broad array of differentiated products and services to ensure we were meeting global needs of customers and consumers day in and day out. We were proud to be recognized multiple times for our work across the ESG spectrum, from being named a Financial Times Diversity Leader and being featured on Newsweek’s Most Loved Workplaces list, to our inclusion on the Investor’s Business Daily Best ESG Companies compilation and our fourth straight year of being named to Ethisphere’s World’s Most Ethical Companies list. And most of all, when faced with a horrific war that impacted both our business and our colleagues, Team ADM stepped up, supporting our teammates and the people of Ukraine. The company and our colleagues together provided millions of dollars in support for the people of Ukraine, and many personally became involved in relief work, whether by packing food or by offering their own homes to colleagues who fled the war. I am proud and thankful for their efforts. As we look ahead, we expect another strong year in 2023. Our Productivity, Innovation and Culture work will continue to power growth and support returns. And our team will continue to deliver on our purpose: to unlock the power of nature to enrich the quality of life. Sincerely yours,",
36,Citigroup,Commercial Banks,"238,104",101078,91270,14845,14.7,C,"Dear shareholders, Looking back at 2022, I don’t think any of us could have predicted the twists and turns the year would take. Lingering disruptions to supply chains, historic inflationary pressures, persistent lockdowns in China and the largest war on European soil since World War II combined to create a tumultuous environment for businesses and financial markets. As a leading global bank with a more-than-210-year history, these dynamics are not unfamiliar to us. And as we showed throughout the pandemic, Citi is an important source of strength and stability during times of immense change and challenge. This is an opportunity and a responsibility we take very seriously. So, for me, 2022 will be remembered most for two things: The first is how we continued to support our clients. We helped them navigate macro and geopolitical dynamics. We advised them in their digital transformations and supported the shifts in their business models. We guided them in their transitions toward a clean-energy economy. When war broke out in Ukraine, we sprang to the aid of our employees and clients on the ground, and helped our multinational clients unwind their operations in Russia in response to Western sanctions aimed at the country. The second is the important strides we are making to position Citi to win in the decade ahead. In March 2022, at our first Investor Day in several years, we set a vision and refreshed our strategy to change our business mix and simplify our operating model. We have absolute clarity on our future, and we are focused on accelerating growth, gaining share and increasing returns for shareholders over time. By most measures, we ended the year in a stronger position than we started. A foundation for the future Our vision for Citi is to be the preeminent banking partner for institutions with cross-border needs, a global leader in wealth management and a valued personal bank in our home market. To that end, we have laid the foundation by focusing on five core interconnected businesses: Services, Markets, Banking, Global Wealth Management and U.S. Personal Banking. We intentionally designed our business mix to withstand different macroeconomic conditions, and we have seen that borne out over the past year. So whilst the environment has changed, our strategy has not, and we remain steadfast in executing and delivering for our shareholders. For the year, we delivered $14.8 billion in net income on revenues of $75.3 billion. Our Return on Tangible Common Equity (RoTCE1 ) was 8.9%, and we remain on track to achieve an RoTCE of 11–12% in the medium term. We increased our Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio by nearly 80 basis points to 13%, which includes a buffer of 100 basis points above the regulatory requirement to help absorb the impact of various macro and other factors. Finally, our tangible book value per share1 increased to $81.65, and we returned more than $7 billion to our shareholders through common dividends and share repurchases. How our core businesses fared Our Services business had an exceptional year with revenues up 27% versus 2021. Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS), the crown jewel of our global network, experienced a 32% increase in revenues as we continued to grow our wallet share with existing clients whilst also adding new client relationships. With the introduction of a seven-day sweeps service, the industry’s first 24/7 USD clearing capabilities and instant payments in 33 markets, we’re moving closer to an always-on, near real-time cash management solution for corporate clients. In Securities Services, we grew yearly revenues by 15% and onboarded $1.2 trillion in assets under custody and administration. Our Markets business closed 2022 with revenues up 7% from 2021, ending the year with one of the best fourth quarters in recent memory. Our traders navigated the volatility quite well, with notable performance amongst corporate clients and strong gains in FX and rates. And together with our Corporate Bank, our Markets team continued to optimize its balance sheet. Revenues in Banking fell 35% as we contended with a materially slower deal environment. But Banking remains a key part of our strategy, and we continued to play a leading role in the year’s notable transactions. This included acting as one of the lead advisors on Volkswagen’s €9.4 billion IPO of Porsche, the largest public listing of the year, and serving as financial advisor to Amgen on its proposed $27.8 billion acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics. We hired exceptional bankers in healthcare, clean energy and technology — all sectors critical to our growth — and welcomed new talent into our Commercial Bank as it has expanded into Canada, Germany and Switzerland. In U.S. Personal Banking, revenues for the year rose 7% as we bolstered our leadership in payments and lending. Branded Cards grew revenues by 9%, whilst Retail Services revenues were up 7%. We launched new credit cards with ExxonMobil and AT&T and celebrated 35 years of our co-branded credit “We have absolute clarity on our future, and we are focused on accelerating growth, gaining share and increasing returns for shareholders over time.” Letter to shareholders 2 3 Celebrated 35 years of the American Airlines co-branded credit card, a leading airline rewards credit card Hired exceptional talent in Banking, Capital Markets and Advisory to strengthen coverage of growth sectors such as healthcare, clean energy and technology Expanded the Private Bank to France and Germany, opened the first Citi Global Wealth Center in Hong Kong and established a Citi Global Wealth at Work presence in Luxembourg Grew Citi Commercial Bank by expanding into Canada, Germany and Switzerland and hiring talent to execute on our client-centric coverage model Served as one of the lead advisors on Porsche’s IPO and as financial advisor on Amgen’s proposed acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics Onboarded $1.2 trillion of new assets under custody and administration in Securities Services Enhanced risk and controls by improving stress test capabilities and our approval process for new products Debuted a refreshed strategy for improving returns at Citi’s Investor Day Built out digital capabilities in our market-leading Treasury and Trade Solutions business and launched a 24/7 payments clearing service Simplified our operating model by closing the sale of five consumer businesses and announced plans to end nearly all operations in Russia Strengthened connections between businesses resulting in more than 60,000 client referrals from the U.S. Personal Bank to Citi Global Wealth Implemented new performance management framework to drive excellence and accountability across the firm A year of progress 4 5 1 RoTCE and tangible book value per share are non-GAAP financial measures.

Revenues in Retail Banking were roughly flat for the full year, but we continued to enhance our digital capabilities, growing digital users by 6% for the year. And as part of our efforts to break down barriers to banking, last year we became the first of the largest U.S. banks to completely eliminate overdraft fees and returned item fees for our customers. We also made progress building out our Global Wealth Management business despite the economic headwinds that slowed activity amongst our Asia-based clients in particular and reduced overall revenues by 2%. Having unified our Wealth businesses under a single platform, we’ve been acquiring new clients and investing in hiring advisors to make sure we’re well-positioned for success as the markets recover. In addition, we forged ahead with our global expansion, opening Private Bank offices in Paris and Frankfurt, a new Wealth center in Hong Kong and a Citi Global Wealth at Work presence in Luxembourg. Greater connectivity and focus A centerpiece of our go-forward plan is increasing the linkages between our businesses so we can more easily engage clients in one part of our firm with products and services from another. By delivering the full power of Citi to clients, we can deepen existing relationships and win new mandates. Our Markets and Banking businesses are now aligned more closely than ever, and, as a result, we are supporting our clients in a more integrated way. Our Wealth business is also benefiting from closer connections and received more than 60,000 referrals from the Retail Bank last year. In addition, we have established a new partnership agreement between Wealth and our Commercial Bank, where 90% of our clients are privately owned companies. At the same time, we are making progress in simplifying our firm, making us easier to manage and allowing us to focus on the parts of our business where we know we can grow and improve our competitiveness. We announced our intention to exit 14 consumer businesses in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Mexico — businesses that do not have clear synergies with our global network. As a result of swift but disciplined execution, in 2022 we successfully closed the sale of our consumer businesses in Australia, Bahrain, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. In March 2023, we closed the sale of our consumer businesses in India and Vietnam and are on track to close two additional markets by the end of the year. We also are progressing with the wind-down of our consumer business in Korea. In addition to exiting our consumer and local commercial banking businesses in Russia, we are actively ending nearly all institutional banking services in the country, and by the second quarter of 2023, our only operations will be those necessary to fulfill any legal and regulatory obligations. Apart from Russia, Citi will continue to serve our clients and invest in these markets through our institutional franchise and our Wealth business. Citi’s Transformation For our strategy to unlock the greatest possible value, we know we need to modernize our infrastructure so that we are scaled and agile and able to continue to deliver for our clients. The consent orders issued in 2020 by the Federal Reserve Board and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency underscored how we had underinvested not only in parts of our infrastructure but also in our risk and controls environment and our data governance. Last year, we made progress in accelerating our work to address these gaps and simplify and modernize our operating model for the digital age. This work is so consequential in nature that we call it our “Transformation.” It remains my number one priority. Whilst this is a multi-year journey, we are already seeing the fruits of our labors. We have dramatically streamlined our approval process for new products. And new stress testing capabilities enable us to make faster, better-informed risk decisions. This made a huge difference in how we have been able to minimize the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on all parts of our business. Investments in our people and communities Ensuring we have a culture characterized by excellence and accountability underpins the success of our Transformation and broader vision for the firm. Last year, we launched a program, Citi’s New Way, to help our colleagues adopt the everyday habits we need in order to operate with excellence. We have also hardwired accountability into our firm by strengthening our performance management process and implementing a greater emphasis on financial returns rather than on revenues. The diversity of the nearly 240,000 people who work at Citi is a distinguishing aspect of our firm, as is the diversity of our Board, which is majority female. We remain committed to a workplace that mirrors the communities we serve. In 2022, we set new goals to increase the number of women and other underrepresented groups working at Citi. These new goals follow our success in exceeding the three-year goals we set in 2018 to increase the percentage of women in the firm globally and of Black talent in the U.S. In another sign of our progress, last year we celebrated the promotion of one of the largest and most diverse Managing Director classes in recent years. Maintaining a workplace that is diverse, equitable and inclusive is not only true to our values but key to our competitiveness. Our commitment to advancing diversity, equity and inclusion goes well beyond Citi’s walls as we continue to use our resources as a global bank to take on some of society’s toughest challenges. We expanded the Citi Impact Fund to $500 million in support of diverse founders who are driving both financial and social returns. And we delivered on our commitment to transparency and accountability by announcing the findings from an external review and audit of our $1 billion Action for Racial Equity initiative to help close the racial wealth gap. We have also been a leader in reimagining the future of work. Drawing on lessons learned during the pandemic, we have institutionalized a hybrid work model for much of our firm. This approach provides the flexibility that our people want whilst also ensuring we benefit from the in-person collaboration, real-time coaching and apprenticeship that occurs only when we are physically together. Everywhere you look around the firm, there is an undeniable sense of momentum. We have never been clearer about the bank we want to be, and we have made significant progress over the past year in bringing this vision to life. Through our relentless commitment to excellence, we are changing the trajectory of Citi to close the gap with our competitors and deliver a new era of success for all our stakeholders. Sincerely,",
37,United Parcel Service,"Mail, Package and Freight Delivery","404,700",100338,166189,11548,11.5,UPS,"2022 was a record year for UPS in many ways. For the first time in our 115-year history, UPS generated more than $100 billion in consolidated revenue. Additionally, our consolidated adjusted* operating margin reached 13.8%, the highest in 15 years, and adjusted* return on invested capital was 31.3%, up 50 basis points from 2021. We achieved these results, and much more, due to the hard work and efforts of our more than 500,000 employees and the outstanding service they provided to our customers. I continue to be impressed by the resiliency of our people and their commitment to moving our world forward by delivering what matters. As the calendar year ended, I reflected on 2022 and how much changed during the year. We experienced geopolitical tensions including a war, high global inflation, China’s pivot away from its zero-COVID policy and consumers’ return to pre-pandemic shopping behaviors, all of which meant global supply chains had to continually adjust. But no matter what came our way, we stayed on strategy – Customer First, People Led, Innovation Driven. By executing our strategy and controlling what we could control, we delivered for our customers and shareowners in 2022. Here are some highlights: •Grew small and medium-sized business (SMB) volume to 28.0% of total U.S. volume, driven by continued expansion of our Digital Access Program (DAP) and the launch of Deal Manager. •Delivered excellent service to our customers around the globe, anchored by the fifth consecutive year of industryleading service in the U.S. • Increased the efficiency of our network by adding our 8th regional hub in the U.S. and implemented Total Service Plan to enable an on-time U.S. network. •Opened our largest natural gas fueling station within our network and shifted to 100% renewable electricity in both global data centers. • Launched smart package smart facility RFID label technology in 101 buildings in the U.S. • Introduced our delivery density solution that uses upstream data to link packages together for last mile delivery, reducing cost in the network. •Acquired Delivery Solutions and invested in CommerceHub as we combine digital solutions with our integrated physical network. • Flexed the International network to match volume levels and generated an industry-leading adjusted operating margin. United Parcel Service, Inc. 55 Glenlake Parkway, N.E. Atlanta, GA 30328 20, 2023 Dear Fellow Shareowners: March •Added 6.1 million square feet of healthcare-compliant distribution space, including the acquisition of Bomi Group, and expanded UPS Premier to 45 countries to grow faster in global healthcare. •Generated $9.0 billion in free cash flow* and repaid $2 billion of long-term debt to reach our targeted adjusted* debt/EBITDA of 1.4 turns. •Returned $8.6 billion to shareowners, a 119% increase above 2021, consisting of $5.1 billion in dividends and $3.5 billion in share buybacks. CUSTOMER FIRST, PEOPLE LED, INNOVATION DRIVEN When we say Customer First, we mean it. We are laser-focused on reducing friction in the customer experience by improving how we acquire, engage and support customers, which is enabling us to grow in the most attractive parts of the market. This includes solutions like DAP, which makes it easier for SMBs to do business with UPS. DAP generated more than $2.3 billion in revenue in 2022. During the year we introduced Deal Manager, our digital pricing solution. Deal Manager applies pricing science to present the customer with the right offer the first time, enabling us to close deals faster and with better revenue quality. We are expanding DAP and Deal Manager to countries outside of the U.S., with DAP already available in 42 countries and Deal Manager expanding to more than 40 countries. We track progress in Customer First by improvements in our Net Promoter Score (NPS). In 2022, we made strong gains in 16 customer journeys, including the three most important: negotiate value, reroute a package and resolve a claim. The improvements we saw in our NPS outpaced the competition, and we finished the year at 42**, putting us well on our way to our target NPS of 50. Moving to the People Led part of our strategy, our people are our most valuable asset, and it is important to us that every UPSer views our company as a great place to work. We know that when we take care of our people, they will take care of our customers. In 2022, we invested in our people to equip them with digital fluency skills, and under Total Service Plan, we created individualized dispatch plans for our drivers to give them more choice over the hours they work. For our front-line employees, we’ve accelerated investments to make their work environments better by improving lighting, adding fresh paint, renovating restrooms and breakrooms, and installing additional cooling stations. We have great jobs with industry-leading pay and benefits and great relationships with our employees. In fact, in 2022 we reached contract extension agreements with the Independent Pilots Association and our aircraft maintenance technicians. Soon we will begin contract negotiations with the Teamsters and we believe a win-win-win outcome is very achievable. And for our nearly 40,000 full-time management employees, we changed the composition of their pay by increasing the cash component, taking action to address their top area of concern. We measure our progress in People Led by how likely an employee is to recommend others to work at UPS. When I joined UPS, likelihood to recommend (LTR) was 51%, and in 2022 it reached 60%. Our goal is to reach an LTR of 80% or higher. Lastly, Innovation Driven is about driving more productivity from the assets we own. Throughout the year, we leveraged the agility of our global integrated network to navigate the dynamic macro environment. Our engineers and operating teams used technology to guide their decisions to adjust the network in line with volume levels while providing outstanding service to our customers. Productivity initiatives like Total Service Plan, our smart package smart facility RFID technology and additional automation are unlocking greater efficiency and flexibility across our network. And we aim to make it even smarter, more automated and more efficient. On the environmental front, in 2022 we took delivery of over 2,300 alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles, bringing our rolling laboratory to more than 15,600. Also in 2022, we created a growth platform we call logistics as a service, which adds new digital capabilities to our best-in-class integrated network. Under this platform, we launched our upstream delivery density solution where we continue to add customers and are seeing positive results. We measure Innovation Driven by delivering higher returns on invested capital, and in 2022, we delivered an adjusted* return on invested capital of 31.3%, 50 basis points above 2021. As an innovation-driven company guided by a strong purpose, our culture centers around the values established by our founder Jim Casey. He believed that we should give back to the communities we serve, and that we have a responsibility to all stakeholders for social and environmental stewardship. We approach sustainable development holistically to ensure our cross-functional sustainability initiatives align with our Customer First, People Led, Innovation Driven strategy. The execution of our strategy will help us reach our goals of carbon neutrality by 2050 and improving the well-being of one billion lives by 2040. We have an action plan to get us there and we are committed to pursuing planet-friendly solutions that enable us to continue to take care of our employees and serve our customers, stakeholders and communities without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. BETTER AND BOLDER Over the past two and a half years, we have fundamentally improved nearly every aspect of our business under our better not bigger framework, resulting in greater agility and stronger financial performance. Building on this foundation, we are transitioning to the next phase of our strategic framework… better and bolder. We will always get better and will continue to focus on growing value share, improving the customer experience and driving higher productivity from the assets we own. Bolder is about moving faster to grow in our targeted market segments and combining digital solutions with our global integrated network. It’s about growing our business around the edges to create powerful new offerings like logistics as a service. This suite of digital solutions further transforms the customer experience and creates new revenue streams for UPS. Looking at the macro in 2023, the current environment is uncertain at best; however, we believe uncertainty creates opportunity. To that end, we are accelerating investments with a focus on three wildly important initiatives: improving the customer value proposition, increasing talent development and employee engagement, and leveraging our physical network with our digital platform to drive efficiency and logistics as a service. The agility of our integrated network, coupled with continued investment in our business, will enable us to quickly pivot as needed in an uncertain environment and enhance our ability to capture growth opportunities as we come out of this cycle. To wrap up, I want to encourage all shareowners to vote your shares at our Annual Meeting in May. This is your opportunity to share your views with us. We listen and take your feedback into account as we seek to grow our business, further improve governance and create long-term shareowner value. As we approach the Annual Meeting, I encourage you to contact us with any questions or feedback at 404-828-6059. UPS has a proud past and an even brighter future, and we believe our best days are ahead of us. We will get there by making bolder moves to digitally transform the customer experience to drive growth while continuing to drive efficiency",

They have pursued impactful breakthroughs with the goal of dramatically changing the lives of patients for the better. As a result of this unwavering commitment to innovation and patients, 2022 was a simply remarkable year for our company on multiple fronts. • We secured eight key regulatory approvals, completed 13 regulatory submissions and initiated 10 pivotal study starts, as we continue to advance our robust R&D pipeline of potential breakthrough medicines and vaccines. • We maintained our industry-leading clinical success ratesi and further improved our cycle times, which already were among the industry’s best,ii and we did all of this while maintaining our high standards of quality, safety, and scientific rigor. • We completed four acquisitions—Arena Pharmaceuticals, Biohaven Pharmaceuticals, Global Blood Therapeutics, and ReViral— which have further strengthened both our pipeline and our current portfolio of innovative offerings for patients. • We were named to 10 different “best employer” lists, including those published by Forbes, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, and others. • We exceeded $100 billion in revenues for the first time in our 174-year history. • And, most important, more than 1.3 billion patients around the world were treated with our medicines and vaccines.iii A truly humbling achievement. Maintaining Our COVID–19 Leadership During the year, we also continued to lead the battle against COVID-19. As the virus continued to evolve, Pfizer scientists were up to the challenge—using our flexible mRNA platform to swiftly create a new vaccine candidate based on the emerging Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. By September, our BA.4/BA.5- adapted bivalent vaccine had been authorized by both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) as a booster dose for ages 12 years and older. By November, both agencies had authorized it for 5 years of age and older. Then in December, the Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine received FDA authorization as the third 3-µg dose in the three-dose primary series for children 6 months through 4 years of age. We are proud to have maintained our leadership position throughout the public health booster A Letter From Our Chairman & CEO Success rates for Phase 1 are based on a 3-year rolling average (2020-2022); rates for Phase 2 and Phase 3/Registration represent a 5-year rolling average (2018-2022). First in Human (FIH) to approval median phase cycle times are based on 3-year rolling cohort for Phase 1 and 5-year rolling cohort for Phase 2 to Registration. The analysis is at the new molecular entity (NME) level. Industry-leading is defined as Top Quartile amongst peer group companies. The patients treated metric is calculated from Pfizer and third-party datasets. Figures may be limited given the coverage provided by external sources (e.g., calendar duration, geographic and product coverage). Numbers are estimates and in some cases use global volume, daily dosage and number of treatment days to facilitate calculations. Methodologies to calculate estimates may vary by product type given the nature of the product and available data. Patients taking multiple Pfizer products may be counted as multiple patients towards total. Numbers include estimated patient counts from U.S. Patient Assistance Programs, ex-U.S. access & affordability programs, product donations and Global Commercial Access Partnerships (this does not include An Accord for a Healthier World). Historical estimates may periodically be subject to revision due to restatements in the underlying data source. i ii iii A Year In Review 2022 Stories ESG Performance About This Review 5 Pfizer 2022 Annual Review campaign. As of February 22, 2023, we held a 64% market share of bivalent boosters in the U.S.iv—which is a significant expansion on the booster share leadership position that we already held before the bivalent booster launch—and our bivalent booster market shares are even higher in several key markets outside the U.S. We believe our best-in-class mRNA capability, coupled with our proven and reliable manufacturing network, will ensure we are well positioned to continue to adapt our vaccine as needed and get it to people around the world. Our COVID-19 oral treatment, PAXLOVID® (nirmatrelvir tablets and ritonavir tablets), has shown to be an important complementary tool to vaccination strategies for the estimated 40% of the global population at high risk for progressing to severe disease.v PAXLOVID has demonstrated robust efficacy, a consistent safety profile, and potential to help mitigate the burden of COVID-19 on patients and their families, health systems, and societyvi. As of March 1, 2023, we have shipped 44 million treatment courses to 63 countries around the world. Leading the Charge for Equitable Access During the year, we also took bold action to help ensure our breakthroughs get into the hands of those who need them. We’re living in a time when science is increasingly demonstrating the ability to take on the world’s most devastating diseases. Unfortunately, there’s a huge health equity gap in our world that determines which of us can access these innovations—and which of us can’t. At Pfizer, we are committed to helping close this gap as quickly as possible. That’s why we launched An Accord for a Healthier World. Through this groundbreaking initiative, Pfizer now offers on a not-for-profit basis the full portfolio of medicines and vaccines for which we have global rights to 45 lower-income countries—with the hope of giving the 1.2 billion people living in these countries access to hundreds of lifesaving and life-changing products that they couldn’t access before. But as we learned in the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, ensuring supply is only the first step to helping patients. For this reason, another key element of the Accord is collaborating with global health leaders to make improvements in diagnosis, education, infrastructure, innovative financing, and more. I'm proud to say that the first shipments of our products arrived in Rwanda in September 2022, and we are working with them and other governments—including in Ghana, Malawi, and Senegal—on future deliveries, as well as health system improvements to help make sure our products reach those in need. Here in the U.S., I’m equally proud of the important work being done by Pfizer’s Multicultural Health Equity Collective, which recently convened more than 100 health equity luminaries from across the U.S. to engage in candid conversations about the drivers and impact of systemic racism on healthcare. The dialogue highlighted creative solutions that are already starting to reduce health disparities in local communities across the country. A Bright Future for Pfizer and for Patients Looking ahead, Pfizer’s future appears to be even brighter than our present. We’re in the midst of an 18-month period during which we expect to have up to an unprecedented 19 new products or indications in the market. Fifteen of these 19 are from our internal pipeline with the remaining four coming to Pfizer via recent business development deals. These potential medicines and vaccines cut across a range of therapeutic areas and include candidates for multiple myeloma, prostate cancer, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), flu, pneumococcal disease, migraine, ulcerative colitis, and sickle cell disease—among others. This represents a tremendous opportunity to improve health outcomes for patients around the world. This is the promise of our science at work. And, of course, we have many more potential vaccines and medicines in our pipeline, with numerous launches expected in the 2024-2030 timeframe, if successful in clinical trials and approved. Some of the most promising assets include our oral GLP-1 candidate for diabetes and obesity; potential combination vaccines for flu, COVID-19, and RSV; our potential vaccines for Lyme disease and shingles; multiple new oncology product candidates, including A Letter From Our Chairman & CEO CDC data through Jan 4, 2023.

In addition, given the strength of our balance sheet and cash flows, we will continue to leverage business development opportunities to advance our business strategies and objectives. Our business development efforts remain focused on compelling external science in the form of both later-stage assets, as well as earlier medical innovations, that have the potential to be breakthroughs for patients. We will be looking primarily at therapeutic areas and platforms where we believe we have the scientific skills and acumen to add substantial value and select the most successful targets. In summary, 2022 was an outstanding year for our company, with our key growth drivers providing evidence of the depth and breadth of our portfolio. With the unprecedented wave of innovations expected to emerge from our scientific pipeline in the near term, potential business development activities, our increased investments in our R&D and commercial capabilities, and additional potential new products and indications coming in the second half of the decade, we believe we can build on the momentum we have created to deliver life-changing innovations to even more patients around the world.

39,Lowe's,Specialty Retailers: Other,"244,500",97059,119253,6437,6.6,LOW,"Dear Shareholders, As I reflect on 2022, I feel privileged to work for a team that continues to drive such tremendous progress across the business, despite macroeconomic uncertainty. As a company, we are seeing clear momentum with our Total Home strategy as we position Lowe’s as the one-stop shop for do-it-yourself (DIY) and Pro customers to get everything they need for their home improvement projects. We continue to enhance our omnichannel capabilities, increase our Pro penetration and deliver everyday value for our DIY customers. As a result of this focus, we grew adjusted operating margin1 to 13% in 2022—which is more than a 440-basis point improvement from 2018—reflecting our persistent focus on driving productivity across every aspect of our business. Through our disciplined capital allocation strategy, we remain committed to generating long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. In 2022, we returned $16.5 billion to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. This includes a 31% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, on top of a 33% increase in 2021. 2022 ANNUAL REPORT 1 1 Adjusted operating margin is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation” section for additional information as well as reconciliations between the Company’s GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We continue to focus on taking market share by executing the five pillars of our growthoriented Total Home strategy: → Improve Pro penetration → Accelerate our online business → Expand installation services → Drive localization → Elevate our product assortment Specific to our Pro focus, our investments to better serve this important customer segment are paying dividends. By the fourth quarter of 2022, we delivered 11 consecutive quarters of double-digit Pro comparable sales growth in the U.S. We are capitalizing on this momentum by growing our MVPs Pro Rewards loyalty program, building relationships with Pros through our CRM platform and continuing to expand our product assortment to meet Pro needs. As an essential part of our journey, we continue to invest in our supply chain transformation. As part of the continued rollout of our marketbased delivery model, to date, we have converted 11 geographic regions supporting over 1,000 stores. This model allows us to flow big and bulky products directly to customer homes— unlocking significant capacity and enabling us to further consolidate our leadership position in appliances and set the company up for profitable growth in other big and bulky categories, like grills, riding lawn mowers and vanities. As a demonstration to our commitment to sustainability, we announced a 2050 sciencebased net-zero target across our full value chain, along with targets for renewable energy and product sustainability. We also announced a five-year, $100 million investment in the communities we serve, with a new community impact program called Lowe’s Hometowns that will complete nearly 1,800 community impact projects each year. None of the progress we made in 2022 would have been possible without the hard work and dedication of our 300,000 associates. To attract and retain top talent, we’re focused on becoming the employer of choice in retail, where associates choose to stay and build their careers. That is why we have invested over $3 billion in incremental wage and sharebased compensation for our front-line associates since 2018, including increasing associate wage rates by over 20%. We also recently opened the Lowe’s Tech Hub, a leading-edge collaborative workplace that’s helping us attract top technology talent. 2 LOWE’S COMPANIES, INC. This year we also completed the sale of our Canadian retail business, enabling us to invest more capital into higher-return opportunities in the U.S. to drive long-term, sustainable growth. Despite a macroeconomic environment with many crosscurrents, the home improvement market remains resilient. Disposable personal income is still strong, homeowners have record levels of equity and we have the oldest U.S. housing stock since World War II. More millennials are buying homes, baby boomers are choosing to age in place and remote work is more widespread. While we expect residential investment to remain under pressure in 2023, this unique confluence of demand drivers gives us confidence in the medium- to long-term industry outlook. Through our Total Home strategy and our culture of continuous improvement, we are confident that we will continue to capture market share, improve our operating margin and deliver long-term, sustainable value to our shareholders. Our associates share my passion for serving our customers and striving to win each day, and that’s exactly what we’ll do to continue to deliver winning results. I believe if we give our associates a great place to work, offer our customers a seamless shopping experience in-store and online and make our communities better, Lowe’s will continue to create shareholder value. This is why Lowe’s is well positioned for 2023 and beyond as we continue our journey to become a world-class, customercentric, omnichannel retailer. God bless,",
40,Johnson & Johnson,Pharmaceuticals,"152,700",94943,483576,17941,18.9,JNJ,"2022 was a year of achievement and evolution for Johnson & Johnson. We delivered solid financial performance and enhanced value for our shareholders. We made progress in two significant undertakings: preparing Johnson & Johnson to operate as a faster, more focused twosector company, and initiating the separation of our Consumer Health business, Kenvue. We did all of this in a year when every industry felt the effects of high inflation, geopolitical tension, and continued supply chain disruption. Times like these remind me how privileged I am to lead Johnson & Johnson as the eighth Chairman and CEO in our history. Our company has navigated through many economic cycles while addressing healthcare’s most important unmet needs for 137 years. Over that time, we have learned how to make decisions for the long-term. Our deep commitment to Our Credo values, and determination to use our size for good, have long made us a global leader in health. Focusing on patient and customer needs reinforces our sense of purpose and urgency. Thanks to the 150,000 employees who embody these ideals—and the breadth and diversification of our business—2022 was a successful year. Performance and Priorities In 2022, we achieved full-year operational sales growth of more than 6%*. Adjusted net earnings were $27 billion* and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $10.15*, representing increases of 3.2% and 3.6% respectively, compared to 2021. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted net earnings per share increased by 9.2%*. We invested nearly $15 billion in R&D, deployed more than $17 billion toward acquisitions, increased our dividend for the 60th consecutive year, and returned capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program. Our total shareholder return (TSR) for 2022 outperformed both our Competitor Composite and the S&P 500, contributing to our TSR of nearly 13% compounded annual growth rate over the last ten years. This significant value creation was made possible by both our long-term strategic focus and outstanding execution from teams in all three segments of our business. MEDTECH We performed in line or ahead of our competitive composite for the past two years. Growth was driven by our focused commercial strategies, the successful launch of differentiated products, and improvements in global procedure recovery. • We delivered on our innovation agenda by accelerating the cadence of new products and significantly enhancing our MedTech pipeline, which included more than 20 programs with over $100 million of net present value potential in 2022. • MedTech delivered operational sales growth* across all businesses in 2022: Orthopaedics, Surgery, Interventional Solutions, and Vision. • The acquisition of Abiomed positions us as the global leader in heart recovery, immediately enhances our MedTech revenue growth, and further diversifies our portfolio (which now includes 12 priority platforms with over $1 billion in annual revenue). Dear Shareholders, Joaquin Duato Chairman and CEO MARCH 2023 Chairman’s Letter 1 PHARMACEUTICAL We strengthened our position as a leading pharmaceutical company by delivering our 11th consecutive year of above-market adjusted operational sales growth, excluding our COVID-19 vaccine. • Our growth was driven by several of our oncology and immunology medicines, including DARZALEX, ERLEADA, STELARA, and TREMFYA. • We continue to investigate new indications and transformative regimens to reach even more patients, including DARZALEX in front-line multiple myeloma, ERLEADA in early-stage prostate cancer, TREMFYA in Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, and RYBREVANT in combination with lazertinib in front-line, non-small-cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations. • Investment in our pipeline further strengthened our portfolio of multiple myeloma medicines. In addition to the launches of CARVYKTI, our first cell therapy, and TECVAYLI, a first-in-class bispecific antibody, we submitted a BLA for talquetamab, an investigational, off-the-shelf bispecific antibody. CONSUMER HEALTH We made significant strides toward the separation of the business into an independent company while also delivering solid performance for the year. • We rolled out the Kenvue name and brand, reflective of both Johnson & Johnson’s storied history and Kenvue’s bright future as a standalone organization. • We appointed leadership, including Thibaut Mongon as CEO Designate, Paul Ruh as CFO Designate, and Larry Merlo, former Chairman and CEO of CVS, as NonExecutive Chair Designate of Kenvue. • Starting in 2023, we began operating our consumer business as a company within a company. Earlier this year, Kenvue filed a Form S-1 with the SEC, giving us the option to pursue an IPO as a potential step in the separation, and we remain on track to complete the process during 2023. We know that to have the greatest impact on patients, we must continue prioritizing the most promising opportunities. Our ongoing emphasis on building digital capabilities, including AI, data science, and intelligent automation, will fuel the next wave of innovation at the intersection of science and technology. 2 Delivering for the world #2rank in the Access to Medicine Index, reflecting our decadeslong strategy to maximize access to our innovative medicines and technologies $ 5+ billion global impact spend with small and diverse suppliers 5 consecutive years of recognition with a CDP A-List rating for our leadership in climate action 12 weeks of paid parental leave for qualified Johnson & Johnson employees around the world 100% renewable electricity secured for our operations in Brazil through a Direct Power Purchase Agreement starting in 2023 $ 52 million committed to programs focused on closing the racial health gap as part of Our Race to Health Equity initiative, with investments in community health centers, health literacy education, and increasing racial diversity in the healthcare talent pipeline and workforce 10 African countries where a $15 million commitment from the Johnson & Johnson Foundation to the Africa Frontline First Catalytic Fund is providing support to community health workers 2.2 billion doses of VERMOX donated since 2006 to facilitate treatment of intestinal worms Chairman’s Letter 60 straight years of increased dividends 3 number of companies in the world with a AAA credit rating, including Johnson & Johnson $ 14.6 billion invested in R&D #1rank on Fortune’s Most Admired Companies list for the Pharmaceutical industry ~65% of 10-year free cash flow* returned to shareholders $ 17.7 billion invested in mergers and acquisitions 29 brands and platforms with more than $1 billion in sales in 2022 3 The Opportunity and Responsibility to Lead As I met with customers, partners, government officials, and employees around the world during my first year as CEO, I was constantly reminded of what the world expects from us. We are a partner of choice. People depend on us to deliver, and they want us to succeed. Johnson & Johnson is held in the highest regard and held to the highest standards—as we should be. This affirms our purpose and motivates us every day. These standards were set in no small part by my predecessor, Alex Gorsky. I am deeply honored to serve as Chairman and CEO following his retirement. Alex laid a strong foundation for the future, anchored in the people of Johnson & Johnson. They have always been our greatest strength, and their commitment to Our Credo fills me with confidence and inspiration every day. 2023 will be one of the most important years in our history—a new chapter not just for one, but two leading global companies. Johnson & Johnson is uniquely positioned to lead our industry through a fast-moving healthcare landscape. As the world evolves, Johnson & Johnson will evolve ahead of it. We know we can do this because we’ve done it so many times before. Putting patients at the center of all that we do keeps us looking forward and open to opportunity. We have achieved success for more than a century by staying true to our mission of serving patients and families, doctors and nurses, our employees and communities, and all others who depend on us. We have so much more we can do for the world, and there’s no time to waste. Sincerely",
41,FedEx,"Mail, Package and Freight Delivery","464,400",93512,57431,3826,4.1,FDX,"To our FedEx stockholders, I am honored to write to you for the first time as President and CEO of FedEx Corporation. It has been my greatest privilege to learn firsthand from our founder Frederick W. Smith, a visionary titan who successfully led this company for its first 50 years. Now, as I take on the role of President and CEO of FedEx, I feel immense pride in what our organization has already accomplished, how we’ve upheld our promise to deliver outstanding experiences, and the bright future ahead. Connecting people to possibilities for 50 years FedEx was founded to connect people in ways others could not. To deliver in ways that created possibilities. As the need for reliable supply was brought to the forefront over the last few years, it was our ecosystem of team members across over 220 countries and territories that kept our customers, global trade, and society moving. The world grows more complex every day, yet our commitment to service and the Purple Promise — to make every FedEx experience outstanding — remains constant. We are at a pivotal moment in our history as we enter our 50th year, and I am honored to share the vision of how we are delivering what’s next. Because even after decades of changing the world, we are just getting started. Unlocking the full potential of our network The FedEx network is our distinctive strength and one that is exceptionally difficult to replicate — an unmatched combination of scale, access, and flexibility. Now, we’re ready to unlock the value from this foundation. This will shape how we operate, collaborate, and invest to Deliver Today and Innovate for Tomorrow. How we’re going to deliver Our strategy, Deliver Today and Innovate for Tomorrow, aligns both our short-term and long-term goals. Deliver Today captures the immediate work at hand, with three key strategies to drive stockholder value: 1. We will create strong annual revenue growth with a focus on driving premium yields and balanced growth, achieved through specific commercial levers, such as focusing on high-value customer segments. We will concentrate on operational levers, including data-driven customer insights and the optimization of existing infrastructure, to enhance our levels of service and increase capacity — with rigorous business planning and strict return on invested capital (ROIC) requirements guiding every dollar of new capital expenditure (CapEx) deployed. 2. We will increase focus on margin expansion and profitable growth by delivering through a more efficient network. FedEx Ground will harness the power of the network we have been building since inception, and we will continue to win in the attractive less-than-truckload (LTL) market at FedEx Freight. Additionally, we will enhance FedEx Express profits from a physically integrated European operation. With over 95% of U.S. revenue generated by customers who use more than one of our operating companies*, there is an opportunity to maintain the advantages of our distinct networks while leveraging enterprise capabilities. We are undergoing a transformation that will enable increased collaboration between FedEx Ground, FedEx Express, and FedEx Freight by enhancing asset utilization to move packages seamlessly through the network, improving customer experience and, at the same time, reducing our cost to serve and expanding margins. 3. We will lower capital intensity and increase ROIC for future investments with thoughtful, precise allocation. To enhance returns through profitable growth and capital efficiency, we will reduce fleet investment, elevate ROIC, and drive higher dividend payouts and stock buybacks. Our focus on execution and driving higher returns, paired with lowered capital intensity, is expected to drive stockholder value over the next three years and beyond. These efforts will combine to significantly increase Total Stockholder Return (TSR) by FY25. The entire FedEx leadership team is united in our determination to achieve these goals. Together, with our Board, we have integrated TSR into our long-term incentive program to ensure disciplined execution. 2022 Annual Report 1 Supporting these goals are our three strategic operating principles: ¹ Compete Collectively reinforces customer centricity as the foundation for every experience FedEx delivers. ¹ Operate Collaboratively transforms the way we work across operating companies to improve the customer experience, asset utilization, and financial performance. ¹ Innovate Digitally harnesses data and technology to make supply chains smarter. And this is just the beginning We have bold visions for FedEx. Our intelligent supply chains, unique culture, and unwavering commitment to sustainability provide a blueprint as we Innovate for Tomorrow. With organization-wide infrastructure modernization, new data-driven offerings, and sustainability-driven solutions, we’re leveraging the power of technology to make supply chains smarter for everyone. And, of course, our culture and people will keep us moving forward. With our People-Service-Profit philosophy, we will continue to develop the entrepreneurial spirit of our people and communities. Our next step In closing, we stand at a pivotal moment in our company’s history. We are focused on balanced growth and revenue quality, expanding our margins, and increasing returns on capital. As we evolve and better serve our customers, our people, and our stockholders, we are delivering the next half century of our legacy. I hope you share in our confidence as we chart the path forward for FedEx. Sincerely,",

The strong earnings growth delivered in 2022, combined with the robust membership growth and financial outlook for 2023, increases our confidence in our midterm Adjusted earnings per share target of $37 in 2025. Strong industry fundamentals As an industry leader in senior-focused, integrated value-based care, delivering higher-quality outcomes at a lower cost, Humana is well positioned in the fastest growing segment in healthcare, which will drive significant value in the mid- and long-term. Dear fellow stockholders, This penetration rate is up 1,200 basis points from 2018 to January 2023, and we expect high single digit growth rates for the MA industry through 2025.6 Medicare Advantage, with its strong demographic growth and superior value proposition, provides significant growth opportunity ahead. Currently, there are 59.4 million Medicare-eligible individuals in the United States.2 Thanks to strong demographic growth tailwinds, this addressable market will continue to grow, and by 2030, one in five U.S. residents will reach retirement age.3 When customers age into Medicare eligibility, they have a choice to either enroll in an MA plan or the Original Medicare program. We believe customers choose an MA product in large part because of the exceptional clinical outcomes and enhanced value proposition. MA members have 43% fewer avoidable hospitalizations than Original Medicare, and MA products provide $184 of additional benefits relative to Original Medicare on average, nationally.7 It is also noteworthy that MA plans meaningfully over index in supporting underserved populations, with a majority of Hispanic Americans and nearly half of African Americans choosing an MA product.8 In addition, 39% of individuals eligible for Dual Eligible Special Needs Plan (DSNP) are enrolled in a DSNP plan as of January 2023, up from 22% at the end of 2018.9 2 Our ability to continue to provide better outcomes for our members and patients, while also delivering compelling returns to our stockholders, is underpinned by strong fundamentals in the MA industry and bolstered by Humana’s differentiated capabilities and growing payer agnostic CenterWell platform, along with our continued discipline in and focus on productivity and operating efficiencies. KURT HILZINGER Chairman of the Board BRUCE BROUSSARD President and Chief Executive Officer 3 Humana’s growth in MA has outpaced the industry historically, with compounded annual growth (CAGR) of 10.4% between 2018 and 2022, while the industry grew at a rate of 9.7% over the same period.10 In addition, we expect growth of at least 5,000 individual MA members for 2023, representing annual growth of 1 . 7 %, meaningfully outpacing industry growth. This strong track record of above-industry growth is supported by our differentiated MA capabilities, including our industry-leading value-based care portfolio, our superior clinical quality solutions, and our differentiated customer-centric operations. Humana’s highly diversified value-based care solutions and locally oriented provider relationship models set us apart from our competitors. Humana’s differentiated capabilities 10.4% 1 . 7 % Humana’s expected individual MA membership growth in 2023 Humana’s 2018 to 2022 MA Membership CAGR We support a wide range of value-based models and customized solutions to support providers wherever they are in their journey of migrating to a value-based clinical and operating model. Our partnership model includes options such as partial or full risk, alliance and joint venture models where we invest in growth together. Humana has a robust people, process and technology infrastructure to help providers succeed in value-based care arrangements. We continue to work to increase the penetration of value-based primary care models, given the improved quality and health outcomes these models consistently deliver. Based on 2021 data, members supported by value-based providers experienced 9% fewer trips to the emergency room, and overall, 251,000 fewer days in the hospital. These models also deliver superior economic outcomes, reducing total medical costs by an estimated 20.1%, or $6 billion as compared to the same members had they been enrolled in Original Medicare.11 The higher quality and lower costs associated with valuebased primary care creates a virtuous cycle, allowing us to invest cost savings into additional benefits for our members driving greater plan satisfaction, retention and growth at or above industry levels. This is reflected in our plan designs where members associated with valuebased providers receive over $500 more in plan benefits on average annually. These improved experiences and strong value proposition also result in higher relational Net Promoter Score® (NPS)® and retention. We were proud to close 2022 with 70% of our individual MA members being supported by a value-based provider who is incentivized to comprehensively and proactively manage patient needs, leading to improved health outcomes and lower total cost of care. 4 0 0 77 We have been recognized as leading the industry in member satisfaction and are proud that Humana has been named the Best Overall Medicare Advantage Insurance Company by U.S. News and World Report, which created an honor roll based on the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ 2023 Star Ratings for Medicare Advantage plans. Additionally, Humana was rated as the best company for member experience and best company for low-premium plan availability. In 2021, members supported by value-based providers had an 8-point higher NPS versus those supported by fee-for-service providers while retention was 14% higher. The provider also benefits from these models, where physicians practicing under value-based models earn 14.3 cents of every healthcare dollar compared to 6.4 cents for non-value-based physicians.11 Our ability to maintain our leadership position in the MA industry is also supported by our excellence in quality and customer experiences. Our success is demonstrated in areas such as Star Ratings, where 96% of our MA members are enrolled in plans rated 4 stars and above for bonus year 2024.12 Humana has now achieved the highest percentage of members in 4-plus Star contracts across all our national competitors for five consecutive years. The success and capability leadership we’ve experienced is enabled and sustained by consistent operational excellence and industry-leading consumer experience. 5 We remain the largest senior-focused valuebased primary care platform in the United States, closing 2022 with 235 centers, a 14% year-over-year increase. Our centers, which operate under the CenterWell and Conviva brands, were staffed by 671 primary care providers serving over 191,000 Medicare patients at the end of 2022. Humana MA members comprised approximately half of the de novo center panel, while comprising over 70% of our wholly-owned center panel. Our value-based primary care model focuses on personalized patient experience and health outcomes that will continue to reshape how care is provided to seniors. The fee-for-service system oriented to specialized, episodic care is not well structured to meet the needs of an aging population with an increasing chronic disease prevalence where more than half of seniors have two or more chronic conditions, and more than 30% of older Americans have social determinant barriers to health.13,14 This has contributed to critical challenges in senior care, including rising costs and complexity, poor outcomes, and poor access to care. CenterWell Senior Primary Care Value-based primary care is uniquely positioned to solve these problems, combining the trust and influence of the primary care physician-patient relationship and a revenue model that rewards investment in proactive, longitudinal care. When compared to a fee-for-service provider model, our value-based primary care model is oriented to smaller patient panels, offers after-hours and same day appointments, longer appointment times, proactive preventative appointment scheduling, and utilizes a multidisciplinary care team, all of which is designed to drive improved quality and health outcomes. United under the CenterWell brand, we have significantly expanded our payer agnostic healthcare services capabilities, including our senior-focused primary care, pharmacy and home care offerings. We will continue to invest in our growing CenterWell assets and our ability to increase use of these capabilities by our health plan members, while also increasing our total addressable market, unlocking the potential to drive significant Enterprise earnings and margin growth. And as we evolve and accelerate our strategy for continued leadership in an industry that is shifting rapidly toward value-based care, we expect that our CenterWell healthcare services will be an increasingly important contributor to our long-term growth. Our Primary Care Organization continues to improve the operating performance in our wholly-owned centers and we are pleased to report that we increased the number of centers that are contribution margin positive from 88 at the end of 2021 to 110 at year-end 2022, a 25% increase year-over-year. 6 In addition, we increased the number of centers that have reached our $3 million contribution margin target from 18 in 2021 to 31 at the end of 2022. We have also demonstrated compelling member satisfaction, with an NPS of 80, and favorable health outcomes with inpatient admits per thousand and emergency department visits per thousand running 43% and 72% lower than Original Medicare, respectively.15,16,17 Our market-leading, differentiated provider asset is well positioned for continued center expansion and patient panel growth and is expected to be a meaningful contributor to Enterprise earnings in the future. Through accelerated de novo center expansion, programmatic small and mid-size merger and acquisition activity, and improved organic growth in our wholly-owned centers, we anticipate expanding our number of centers by approximately 30 to 50 centers annually over the next several years and are targeting Medicare patient compounded annual growth of 18% to 20%. Looking ahead, we expect to have 400 to 450 centers serving approximately 450,000 patients by 2025. 18 With this growth, we anticipate a contribution of approximately $100 million - $200 million EBITDA from our Primary Care Organization in 2025, growing to more than $1 billion over the next 10 years. 7 The strength of our core fee-for-service home health business was evident in 2022, with total same store admissions up 6.3% year-over-year compared to public peer growth of 0.75%.20 We have also grown the CenterWell Home Health™ penetration rate of Humana home health episodes in markets where there is geographic overlap from 8% in 2017 when we entered into our initial transaction with Kindred at Home (now CenterWell Home Health) to 19% in 2022.21 We are confident we can significantly increase this volume in the years to come. CenterWell Home Health We expect our home health admission growth to continue in the mid-single digits in 2023 as we look to offset the declining Original Medicare market with increased penetration of MA patients, including Humana MA members. In addition, CenterWell Home Health is focused on increasing nursing capacity through recruiting and retention initiatives. Our voluntary nursing turnover improved from 31.9% in 2021 to 30.6% in 2022. We continue to invest in clinical orientation and mentors, as well as technology focused on reducing administrative tasks and drive time for clinicians—which we expect to drive further improvement in nurse recruitment and retention. Beyond growing our core fee-for-service home business, we are focused on providing members and patients with access to holistic, value-based care in the home that enhances the experience, improves outcomes, and reduces total cost of care. Our value-based home model, which coordinates care and optimizes spend across home health, durable medical equipment (DME) and infusion services, is now supporting approximately 15% of our MA members—up from 5% coverage in 2021. In addition, we are implementing some of these capabilities on a standalone basis to accelerate value creation. As of January 2023, we rolled out the home health utilization management and network management capabilities to 1.4 million additional members, bringing the total number of covered members to 1.9 million, creating incremental Enterprise value in advance of the full value-based market rollout. With approximately 6% market share,19 CenterWell Home Health is the largest home health provider in the United States and we are well positioned to continue to grow our core home health business going forward. 8 1 million additional members by year end 2023, Looking forward, we expect to expand coverage of the full value-based home model to approximately Today, on average, health plans in Humana markets with the greatest opportunity spend $35 to $40 per member per month on home health, DME and infusion combined. We believe the value-based home health model can reduce these costs for the Enterprise by a net 10% to 15%, thereby generating between $110 million to $150 million of incremental annual Enterprise value creation by 2025. 800,000 of which are currently served under the utilization and network management model, and are on track to cover approximately 40% of our MA members with the full value-based model by 2025. 9 Our pharmacy dispensing business remains strong with industry-leading mail-order penetration at 38.6% for our individual MA members in 2022. In addition, in more mature CenterWell clinics, we have seen mail-order penetration rates for Humana members approach 50% and when combined with prescriptions dispensed by our co-located retail pharmacies, our total CenterWell Pharmacy™ market share can approach 60%. The benefits of mail-order extend beyond our pharmacy operations, leading to better medication adherence and health outcomes, benefiting our members and health plan. As an example, MA members who utilize CenterWell Pharmacy demonstrate medication adherence rates ranging from 650 to 840 basis points higher than we see in traditional retail pharmacies for cholesterol, blood pressure and diabetes treatments. CenterWell Pharmacy Integrating our CenterWell assets As we look to the long term, the growth and maturation of our CenterWell assets are expected to bolster our ability to continue to drive compelling earnings growth and increased cash flow, creating additional capital deployment opportunities. This time period will also allow for the maturation of the potential benefits from the advancement of the integration of our assets in local markets. When we integrate our assets effectively in local markets, we see accelerated volume growth, better experiences and clinical outcomes, and improved Humana Enterprise economics. With a health plan member utilizing the full suite of CenterWell assets, we can drive two to four times the direct margin dollars for the Enterprise versus one that utilizes the health plan alone. In addition, we believe successful integration of our assets can drive additional value in areas such as improved retention and higher Stars scores, which we have not attempted to estimate in the two to four times metric. We believe there is the potential to unlock significant value over time as our integration efforts mature and look forward to providing updates in the future. Our pharmacy business will benefit from the significant growth in individual MA membership in 2023 as we anticipate maintaining our industry-leading mail-order position, further investing in the consumer experience and encouraging the continued use of mail-order, despite comparable copays in the retail setting beginning in 2023. 10 11 Environmental, social and governance We’re continuously working to ensure that our health plan products and services are as affordable as possible, while also creating pathways for access to healthcare, addressing social determinants of health (SDOH) and health-related social needs. Thanks to processes such as integrated care delivery and using health screenings that consider SDOH and health literacy, we have a clearer view of each member’s very personal barriers to their best health. Through use of our proprietary population health analytics capabilities, we’re able to aggregate and stratify more than 90 data sets to help us learn even more about the unique factors impacting a person’s total health, recognizing that helping them with their health often requires addressing environmental conditions, and social and lifestyle factors (housing, education, employment, etc.) that prevent them from getting and staying well. Building trust and taking care of people has always been core to our values and our company’s purpose and mission. As we meet people where they are and make things simpler for them, we begin to establish trust, which gives us the permission space to help them achieve their best health. That’s where real transformational change begins. We know that our role in healthcare goes beyond being a good corporate citizen. For us to have sustainable success as a company, we need to not only have satisfied customers and associates, but we must also contribute to society by tackling larger issues that stand in the way of healthy communities. We are dedicated to improving the health of every person we serve, demonstrated through our environmental, social and governance (ESG) strategy—to improve the health of each person, each community, the healthcare system and our environment— and it’s our steadfast belief that everyone should have access to the resources and support they need to reach their full health potential. 12 With over 60 years of healthcare experience, our ability to impact the healthcare system has only grown. We take this responsibility seriously by adopting best-practice governance and business policies, following rigorous quality and ethical standards, working closely with healthcare providers, and innovating on behalf of those we serve. We understand that 60% of one’s ability to lead a healthy, meaningful life is shaped by environmental conditions and social/lifestyle factors. We’re leaning into that. In our communities, we support the dedicated people and organizations at the forefront of community health, helping accelerate their reach and impact. These collaborations move us towards the goals of eliminating social and structural barriers to health to achieve health equity. Working closely with physicians, clinicians, community partners and national leaders, we’re able to “treat” social needs and expand community capacity to address SDOH. Many of these undertakings involve deep community collaborations, such as establishing a process to screen patients for food insecurity in their doctor’s office and immediately connect them to a local food bank for entitlement program enrollment and emergency food provision. Measuring our progress and addressing opportunities is critical to achieving our strategy and creating value. We know that’s how we continue to build trust with all of our stakeholders, and is why we are committed to transparent reporting on our ESG measures, presenting both our progress and our shortcomings in our annual Impact Report. We encourage you to read about our 2022 ESG initiatives and disclosures across five categories—talent and diversity, access to healthcare, environmental impact, data privacy and protection, and product quality and safety— to learn how we’re operating with you in mind. Because what matters most is you—our customers, our associates, our partners and our communities. 13 Nationally, we are working to advance health equity and are leading by example, using our strengths to bring about lasting change. Whether it’s through the unique programs and services we offer aging adults, veterans, and individuals in communities that have been historically underserved, or through our green energy initiatives, stable housing efforts, and customer data privacy protection, we’re dedicated to providing support in areas where we can make the most difference. In our workplaces, we are creating safe and supportive spaces to nurture professional purpose and individual development. During 2022, approximately 30% of our associates participated in at least one of our 10 associate-led network resource groups that offer opportunities for connection and growth. In addition, we are investing in programs that encourage our teammates to express their talents through mentorship and volunteering, with the goal of increasing diversity, equity and inclusion. Last year alone, 38% of Humana associates rolled up their sleeves, clocking nearly 255,200 volunteer hours, giving back to their communities through acts of service. In closing, our sustained success would not be possible without the trust and dedication of our many stakeholders including our associates, our members and patients, our clinician partners, our governmental partners and our stockholders. We thank each of you for your commitment to Humana and look forward to strengthening our partnership in the future as we continue on our journey of providing better outcomes for our members and patients, while also driving compelling returns to our shareholders.

46,PepsiCo,Food Consumer Products,"315,000",86392,251085,8910,10.3,PEP,"To put it simply, 2022 was a stellar year for PepsiCo. Despite another dynamic period that featured difficult and unpredictable circumstances, we delivered our best financial performance in a decade, whilst staying true to our values and continuing to build a strong, durable foundation for long-term growth—proof that we can deliver sustainable performance, even as we transform our business to meet the challenges of the future. Our success in 2022 is a testament to the agenda we set out in 2019. An agenda focused on transforming a good company into a great one by becoming Faster, Stronger, and Better. At the end of 2021, we took our ambitions a step further, launching PepsiCo Positive (pep+), a strategic end-to-end business transformation designed to drive long-term sustainable business performance and value, with sustainability and human capital at the center. Since then, pep+ has become the North Star for how we want to win in the marketplace, how we want to transform, and how we want to create value for ourselves and others. To make this clear, we elevated it to be part of our overarching vision: to be the global leader in beverages and convenient foods by Winning with pep+. 2022’s fantastic results demonstrate that even in the most trying of times, the investments we have made and our commitment to pep+ are helping us win in the marketplace and create value for our shareholders, as well as our consumers, customers, associates, and communities. FASTER: To be an even Faster company, we are focusing our efforts on continually winning in the marketplace, finding ways to be even more consumer-centric, and accelerating investment for top-line growth, including by pivoting our portfolio. In 2022, we achieved these goals by: 1 • Delivering more than 14% organic revenue growth and 10% growth in core constant currency operating profit—our highest growth levels in the last decade; • Growing core constant currency earnings per share (EPS) by 11%; • Finishing the year strong with 14.6% organic revenue growth in Q4—our fifth straight quarter of doubledigit growth; • Continuing to invest in the business—more than $10 billion in advertising and marketing and capital investments; and • Announcing a 10% increase in our annualized dividend, effective with the dividend expected to be paid in June 2023. This will represent PepsiCo’s 51st consecutive annualized dividend per share increase. In addition to continuing our strong financial performance, we’ve demonstrated an ability to lead with growth and win in the market. In 2022, we: • Ranked #1 in the Kantar PoweRanking for the seventh year in a row; To Our Shareholders, 1. 2022 reported net revenue increased 8.7%. 2022 reported operating profit increased 3%. 2022 reported EPS increased 17%. Q4 2022, Q3 2022, Q2 2022, Q1 2022, and Q4 2021 reported net revenue increased double digits, high single digits, mid-single digits, high single digits, and double digits, respectively. Organic revenue growth, core constant currency operating profit, and core constant currency EPS growth are non-GAAP financial measures. See page 129 “Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Information” for definitions and more information about these results, including a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure in accordance with GAAP. PepsiCo Annual Report 2022 1 • Held or gained share across many of our key markets, including the U.S., Mexico, Brazil, the U.K., China, Saudi Arabia, and India; and • Continued to meet consumers’ needs and improve the consumer experience, making meaningful progress on all key portfolio transformation bets and with significant growth in more nutritious snacking and zero sugar platforms. STRONGER: To be an even Stronger company, we are continuing to transform our capabilities, cost, and culture, especially through innovation and by putting data at the center of our business. We also want our associates to continue to feel proud of our company and engaged with what we are doing. With these goals in mind, in 2022, we: • Made strong progress toward modernizing and fortifying our Enterprise Resource Planning backbone across certain markets and divisions to harmonize global data and business processes with seamless access to critical information; • Continued to build out Global Business Services (GBS) to help fuel PepsiCo’s growth, accelerating the impact GBS can have on productivity, standardization, and process improvement; • Initiated key digital programs in many markets to advance the automation of our business planning processes across our value chain in how we make, move, and sell our products; • Celebrated the 40th anniversary of our Supplier Diversity Program, where we currently spend more than $1 billion annually with certified, diverse suppliers; • Continued to invest in talent development and learning to become the best possible workplace— in two years, over 30,000 people managers and associates have registered for live-interactive leadership development workshops, and many have leveraged performance support content; and • Doubled down on our company culture by relaunching The PepsiCo Way, the seven behaviors that define who we are and how we work, whilst updating their definitions to better reflect our pep+ and digital transformations. BETTER: To be an even Better company, we are striving to create growth and value by operating within planetary boundaries and inspiring positive change for the planet and people. The power that we have as individuals and as a collective group to make an impact in our communities is massive. We know that by doing what’s right for society and the environment, we can position ourselves as a consistent top market performer, generating stronger and more loyal connections with our consumers and customers, engaging more meaningfully with our associates, and building deeper roots in our communities to help them prosper over the long term. This strategic, end-to-end focus has enabled us to make visible progress across the three pillars of pep+: Positive Agriculture, Positive Value Chain, and Positive Choices: Positive Agriculture: We are working to spread regenerative practices to help restore the earth across 7 million acres—land approximately equal to the company’s entire agricultural footprint; sustainably source key crops and ingredients; and help improve the livelihoods of more than 250,000 people in our agricultural supply chain and communities, all by 2030. In 2022, we moved closer to these goals by: • Elevating external strategic partnerships with Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM) to scale regenerative agriculture practices across our shared supply chains, up to 2 million acres in the U.S., and with N-Drip to scale micro irrigation technology to provide water-saving, crop-enhancing benefits to farmers around the world; • Granting funding to 14 projects in 11 countries through our Positive Agriculture Outcomes Fund, helping to tackle some of the most difficult challenges facing agriculture today; and • Continuing to advance the five-year “Investing in Women to Strengthen Supply Chains” Global Development Alliance with the U.S. Agency for International Development. This includes training women on overall farm management as a business, so they can make informed decisions about investment; improving agronomic skills critical for the sustainable or regenerative agriculture transition; building women up to be lead farmers; and improving working conditions. The program is currently operating in Colombia, Pakistan, India, and Vietnam and will soon launch in Peru. 2 PepsiCo Annual Report 2022 Positive Value Chain: We are helping to build a circular and inclusive value chain through actions designed to achieve Net-Zero emissions by 2040, become Net Water Positive by 2030, and help build a world where packaging never becomes waste. As part of this, we are adopting new models and decoupling environmental impact from business growth. In 2022, we took important steps such as: • Establishing a new global packaging goal for 20% of beverage servings to be delivered through reusable models by 2030. We intend to work toward this goal by expanding our SodaStream business, building out our refillable offerings, growing our fountain drinks business with reusable cups, and accelerating growth in powders and tablets; • Announcing plans for PepsiCo Europe that aim to eliminate virgin fossil-based plastic in all its crisp and chip bags by 2030, which will apply to brands including Walkers, Doritos, and Lay’s. We expect to deliver by using 100% recycled or renewable plastic; • 22 markets have at least one product packaged with 100% recycled PET (rPET); • Transforming our Frito-Lay facility in Modesto, California, into a role model for end-to-end sustainability. The facility uses 100% sustainably sourced potatoes under PepsiCo’s Sustainable Farming Program and has achieved a 91% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from direct fleet operations by switching to zero-emission and near zero-emission vehicles—including the world’s first fleet of electric semi trucks from Tesla. We also built fueling and charging infrastructure for the new fleet, with on-site renewable energy generation and storage; and • Advancing our Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I) agenda around our people, business partnerships, and the communities we serve. We have reached 44% gender parity in management globally, whilst increasing U.S. Black and Hispanic representation at the manager level to 9.0% and 10.1%, respectively. We are also expanding our efforts to support historically marginalized communities around the world by increasing diverse representation, supporting our business partners, and helping to create economic opportunity in communities. Positive Choices: We’re inspiring people through our brands to make choices that help create better outcomes for them and the planet. That means continuing to expand portfolio offerings with less added sugar, sodium, and saturated fat, whilst driving new packaging solutions across beverages and convenient foods. In 2022, we made progress on a number of key initiatives, including: • Advancing more nutritious snacking platforms with significant growth in North America driven by brands like PopCorners, SunChips, and Bare, whilst launching the national expansion of PopCorners in the U.K.; • Using more diverse ingredients such as legumes, whole grains, plant-based proteins, fruits and vegetables, and nuts and seeds. This includes launching SunChips Black Beans, a new variety made with whole grains and real black beans, and new Quaker Oats flavor offerings with 100% whole grain oats; • Advancing against our added sugars reduction goal, with Pepsi Zero Sugar now available in 110 international markets and growth in other zero sugar products; and • Leveraging the power of our brands to meet consumer demand for more sustainable packaging. We currently offer reuse models in more than 80 markets, including: SodaStream, SodaStream Professional, Gatorade Gx, fountain beverages, returnable glass and plastic bottles, and concentrates and powders. As we advance our pep+ journey, we know that being a Better company also means continuing to invest in our communities. That’s why we took several critical actions in 2022: • Opening our hearts and our homes to provide necessities and shelter to our Ukrainian colleagues when their lives were turned upside down by the deadly conflict. We also contributed nearly $15 million to relief efforts through donations from the business, our associates, and the PepsiCo Foundation; • Launching One Smile at a Time, our global employee volunteering platform, across nearly all of our top 20 markets, empowering our associates to impact their communities at scale. In 2022, we delivered more than 290,000 hours of service through the platform; and PepsiCo Annual Report 2022 3 • Continuing to make a difference for people around the world through the PepsiCo Foundation by helping increase equitable access to safe water; funding nearly 1,800 scholarships for Black and Hispanic students through the Uplift Community College Scholarship Program; and helping increase food security, delivering more than 20 million meals in 2022 alone. Each example of our success is one piece of a much bigger transformation. A transformation that began in 2019, when we launched our effort to become Faster, Stronger, and Better and turn a good company into a great one. That continued to unfold in 2020 and 2021, when we proved we have the right strategy and the right people. And that accelerated in 2022, a year when we showed the world something new: that it is possible for a large, global company to perform and transform at the same time. I have always been proud of our results, but never more so than today. Thanks to pep+, our strong brands, our market positions, our global strategy, and our incredible team of associates, we have been able to deliver shortterm results, whilst laying the foundation for long-term, sustainable growth. I have been especially proud of the ownership demonstrated by our leaders and our associates. Despite extreme volatility, they made courageous decisions, adapted quickly in every local market, and showed compassion and generosity to our colleagues in Ukraine—a strong testament to our PepsiCo values and what makes us unique. Now, to perform and transform even Faster, even Stronger, and even Better than we did in 2022, we have to take our efforts to the next level. As 2023 will likely carry its own unique set of challenges and opportunities, we’ll focus on five key areas to help us build on the momentum we gained in 2022: • Keeping our categories very relevant to consumers and accelerating our share gains in our key markets; • Setting high ambitions in cost transformation and elevating our focus on cost control in every Business Unit; • Continuing to reinvest heavily in our systems and digital transformation; • Raising the bar in our pep+ transformation, with focus on our portfolio, our DE&I agenda, our communities, and the environment; and • Building high flexibility, agility, and resilience in our planning processes to allow us to pivot quickly as the world changes around us. By staying focused on these priorities, I am confident we will position ourselves to deliver another year of strong results, whilst creating smiles that make a big difference for all of our stakeholders. Thank you for sharing that confidence by entrusting us with your investment. With your support, we will continue to build an even Faster, even Stronger, even Better company—a company that wins in the marketplace and positively impacts society. Not just tod",

Few companies have the privilege of celebrating such a milestone, which is emblematic of our constant evolution and ability to innovate and set the standard for our industry. With the richest set of assets and intellectual property in the media sector and Disney’s legacy of world-class storytelling, we continue to strive to build memories that last a lifetime and nurture deep emotional connections with audiences around the world. Reflecting back on fiscal 2022 and looking forward to the year ahead, we are proud of our accomplishments towards achieving our long-term goals and excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for The Walt Disney Company and its shareholders. Your company has an unrivaled combination of content, creative talent and distribution capabilities that have propelled our worldclass storytelling. We won 6 Academy Awards and 26 Primetime Emmy Awards in 2022 across our studios and achieved an additional 19 news and documentary Emmy wins across ABC News, National Geographic, FX and Hulu. We saw strong revenue and profit growth at our domestic parks in fiscal 2022. We continued to invest in direct-to-consumer streaming throughout the year and ended the fiscal year with more than 235 million direct-to-consumer subscriptions across our services. In November, we announced Bob Iger’s return to the role of Chief Executive Officer. While remaining focused on the ongoing evolution of our core operating model, the Board gave Bob a dual mandate for his two-year term to rebalance investment with return opportunity while retaining the focus on the creative talent that defines Disney and to assist the Board in ongoing leadership succession planning. We are confident that Bob’s deep understanding of the Company and industry through his four decades of experience at Disney, including 15 years as CEO, positions him well to set the strategic direction for our continued value creation, which he has a strong track record of delivering. Bob is simultaneously prioritizing assisting the Board in identifying, developing and mentoring a successor CEO, a process which has already begun. We are also excited to be welcoming Mark Parker into his role as Chairman of the Board, effective following our 2023 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Mark’s four decades of experience at a Fortune 100 consumer-facing company, including his service as executive chairman and as chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer; successful history navigating chief executive officer succession; and deep understanding of the dynamic operating environment currently facing international, consumer-facing companies with global recognition render him ideally suited to take on this role. We want to thank Susan Arnold for her 15 years of dedicated service to Disney. Susan’s leadership on the Board has been invaluable, as she navigated through significant strategic shifts in the business while serving as an exemplary steward of the Disney brand. As a Board, we have continued to evolve to ensure that we have the right combination of backgrounds, skill sets and perspectives to guide the Company into the future. Today, Disney’s Directors bring experience across a relevant range of skill sets including brand, marketing and retail, direct-to-consumer expertise and technology and innovation. We were excited to welcome Carolyn Everson to the Board as a new Director in November. Carolyn is a well-respected leader with deep experience in roles at complex global companies, with a strong background in building world-class media and digital advertising businesses. Carolyn adds to a group of Directors with an optimal combination of experience and skills that are vital to Disney’s strategic priorities, expansive reach, and business mix. We have continued to remain responsive to the feedback of our shareholders across a number of different focus areas.

49,ConocoPhillips,"Mining, Crude-Oil Production","9,500",82156,120777,18680,22.7,COP,"Dear Fellow Shareholders, Energy supply and security were top priorities across the globe in 2022, as geopolitical and economic turmoil contributed to one of the most eventful years for our industry and the world in decades. Against this backdrop, ConocoPhillips demonstrated robust operational and financial results, generating a 27% return on capital employed and returning $15 billion of capital to our shareholders. We also announced new low greenhouse gas (GHG)-intensity production projects to enhance our global portfolio for decades to come, while expanding our commitment to reduce emissions. These achievements align with our Triple Mandate of responsibly and reliably meeting energy transition pathway demand, delivering competitive returns on and of capital, and Letter to Shareholders achieving our net-zero operational emissions ambition. They also reflect the high performance and ingenuity of our workforce. A Decade of Transformation Since our 2012 spinoff, ConocoPhillips has strategically developed a deep and diverse portfolio that continues to generate impressive cash flows. With the completion of our acquisitions in the U.S. Permian Basin and our expanding opportunities in liquefied natural gas (LNG), we have established ourselves as a premier exploration and production company with a large, low cost of supply, low GHGintensity resource base. Our strong balance sheet positions us to thrive through the price cycles of the evolving energy transition. CONOCOPHILLIPS PORTFOLIO TRANSFORMATION In 2022, we safely and efficiently produced more than 1.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day globally, with record production in our Lower 48 operations. We achieved first production at Gumusut Phase 3 in Malaysia, Fiord West Kuparuk in Alaska and Montney’s Pad 4 in Canada, while continuing to progress the Tommeliten A and Eldfisk North projects in Norway. As a major producer in the prolific Permian Basin, we continued to innovate with strategic acreage swaps that allowed us to significantly increase our long-lateral inventory and lower our cost of supply. Our global reserve replacement ratio was 176%, highlighting the breadth and depth of our portfolio. Energy security has reemerged as a top global concern, and ConocoPhillips is well positioned to supply natural gas where it is needed most. “Our strong balance sheet positions us to thrive through the price cycles of the evolving energy transition.” We expect LNG to play a valuable role through the energy transition and beyond, as it is lower in GHG-emissions intensity than other alternatives, particularly coal. Building on our 60 years of LNG expertise, we made commitments to grow our global LNG business in Australia, Germany, Qatar and the United States. In 2022, we increased our ownership in Australia Pacific LNG, which supplies the growing Australian and Asia Pacific markets. We signed agreements with QatarEnergy to participate in the North Field East and the North Field South LNG projects and to jointly supply long-term LNG to Germany, Europe’s largest gas market. In the U.S., we are working with Sempra Infrastructure to develop large-scale LNG and potential carbon capture projects along the Gulf Coast. Fulfilling Our Triple Mandate We achieved a 27% return on capital employed, our highest since becoming an independent company, and returned a record 53% of cash from operations (CFO) — $15 billion return of capital — to our shareholders through dividends, variable return of cash (VROC) distributions and share repurchases in 2022. While this was our first year to offer VROC payments, our total shareholder return over the past five years has represented ~45% of CFO. We believe that our CFO-based returns framework differentiates us relative to peers and is a competitive advantage. Advancing our Paris-aligned climate risk strategy, we joined the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 and further strengthened our methane reduction ambition with a more aggressive near-zero 2030 methane emissions intensity target. We also published our Plan for the Net-Zero Energy Transition with a progress update expected in spring 2023. Our emissions reduction efforts and operational net-zero ambition are supported by our multidisciplinary Low Carbon Technologies organization. In 2022, this team began developing and implementing region-specific plans focused on technology to accelerate emissions reduction. These opportunities include electrification studies, equipment design, enhanced monitoring and detection of methane emissions, reductions in flaring and methane venting volumes, as well as carbon capture and storage.  Generated earnings* of $18.7 billion.  Returned $15 billion of capital to shareholders. 2022 Highlights  Produced 1.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.  Achieved record production in our Lower 48 assets.  Expanded our LNG business in Australia, Germany, Qatar and along the U.S. Gulf Coast.  Introduced Plan for the Net-Zero Energy Transition. *Earnings refers to net income. CONOCOPHILLIPS AT A GLANCE Ryan M. Lance Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Feb. 16, 2023 Collectively, our 2022 actions will help reduce the average GHG-emissions intensity of our 20-billion-barrel low cost of supply resource base, reflecting our commitment to responsibly and reliably meet energy transition pathway demand. World-Class Talent Our collaborative and innovative workforce drives our success, and we recognize the importance of creating a workplace where our people feel valued. In 2022, we continued our efforts to foster a workplace that attracts, retains and develops the best talent. We established a new diversity, equity and inclusion organization and welcomed our first chief diversity officer. We also continued to focus on programs and processes to ensure we have an engaged workforce with the skills to meet our business needs. As always, safety was our top priority. A safe company is a successful company, so I’m pleased to report that in 2022 we had our second-best safety performance since we became an independent company. Our Next Decade The energy business will always be volatile, but we’ve built ConocoPhillips to deliver competitive results throughout price cycles. Aligned with our Triple Mandate, our deep and diversified portfolio will provide the energy to meet demand, deliver compelling returns and fulfill our commitments to shareholders, while we continue to execute on our net-zero operational emissions ambition. As we enter our next decade, ConocoPhillips looks forward to playing a key role in the energy transition by providing secure, dependable, low GHG-intensity energy solutions that help power civilization while enhancing global energy supply and security.",
50,Tesla,Motor Vehicles & Parts,"127,855",81462,656425,12556,15.4,TSLA,"Q4-2022 was another record-breaking quarter and 2022 was another recordbreaking year. In the last quarter, we achieved the highest-ever quarterly revenue, operating income and net income in our history. In 2022, total revenue grew 51% YoY to $81.5B and net income (GAAP) more than doubled YoY to $12.6B. As we progress into 2023, we know that there are questions about the nearterm impact of an uncertain macroeconomic environment, and in particular, with rising interest rates. The Tesla team is used to challenges, given the culture required to get the company to where it is today. In the near term we are accelerating our cost reduction roadmap and driving towards higher production rates, while staying focused on executing against the next phase of our roadmap. Our ASPs4 have generally been on a downward trajectory for many years. Improving affordability is necessary to become a multi-million vehicle producer. While ASPs halved between 2017 and 2022, our operating margin consistently improved from approximately negative 14% to positive 17% in the same period. This margin expansion was achieved through introduction of lower cost models, buildout of localized, more-efficient factories, vehicle cost reduction and operating leverage. In any scenario, we are prepared for short-term uncertainty, while being focused on the long-term potential of autonomy, electrification and energy solutions. Our relentless cost control and cost innovation is why we believe that no other OEM is better equipped to navigate through 2023, and ultimately succeed in the long run, than we are",
51,Procter & Gamble,Household and Personal Products,"106,000",80187,350781,14742,18.4,PG,"Dear Shareowners, Fiscal 2022 was another very strong year as the execution of our integrated strategies continued to yield strong sales, earnings and cash results in an incredibly difficult operating environment. Your Company delivered broad-based and strong top-line growth across our categories and regions, earnings growth in the face of significant cost headwinds, and continued strong cash return to you, P&G’s shareowners. For the fiscal year, organic sales grew 7%, core earnings per share grew 3%, currency-neutral core earnings per share were up 5%, and adjusted free cash flow productivity was 93%. Organic sales growth of 7% continues our strong topline momentum, which is up 13% on a two-year stack (across fiscal years 2021 and 2022) and up 19% on a three-year stack (across fiscal years 2020, 2021 and 2022). Growth this fiscal year was broad-based across business units, with all 10 of our categories growing organic sales. Personal Health Care grew 20%. Fabric Care and Feminine Care grew double digits. Baby Care was up high single digits. Oral Care and Grooming were up mid-single digits. Hair Care, Home Care, Skin & Personal Care and Family Care each grew low single digits. Focus markets grew 5% and Enterprise markets were up 10%. We delivered strong results in our largest and most profitable market, the United States, with organic sales growing 8%. E-commerce sales increased 11%, representing 14% of total Company sales. Global aggregate market share increased 50 basis points, and 38 of our top 50 category/country combinations held or grew share for the year.
Importantly, this share growth is broad based. Nine
of 10 product categories grew share globally over
the past year.
Our bottom-line results include over $3 billion of
earnings headwinds from commodities, freight and
foreign exchange. Despite this, we delivered core EPS
growth within our initial guidance range for the year.
We returned nearly $19 billion of value to shareowners
through $8.8 billion in dividends and $10 billion in share
repurchase. In April, we announced a 5% increase in our
dividend. This is the 66th consecutive annual dividend
increase, and the 132nd consecutive year in which P&G
has paid a dividend. Only seven U.S. publicly traded
companies have paid a dividend in more consecutive
years than P&G, and only three are recognized to have
increased their dividend in more consecutive years
than P&G.
In summary, we met or exceeded each of our going-in
target ranges for the fiscal year — organic sales growth,
core EPS growth, free cash flow productivity and cash
returned to shareowners. This is strong performance
in very difficult operating conditions.

Integrated Strategic Choices
P&G employees have delivered great results over
the past four years in a very challenging macro
environment against very capable competition. In
those four years, P&G people have added more than
$13 billion in annual sales and roughly $5 billion in
after-tax profit — executing our integrated strategies
with excellence.
The progress we have made, and our collective
commitment to our strategies, give me confidence we
can manage through the challenges we will continue
ii • The Procter & Gamble Company
to face. Still, we are clear-eyed about the trials ahead.
The operational, cost and currency challenges we dealt
with over the last two years will continue in fiscal year
2023, and we begin the new fiscal year with consumers
facing inflation levels not seen in the last 40 years.
The best response to the uncertainties and
challenges — double down on the integrated set of
strategies that are delivering very strong results.
We are focused on delighting and serving consumers,
customers, society and shareowners through five
strategic and integrated choices: a portfolio of dailyuse products in categories where performance drives
brand choice; superiority across product, package,
brand communication, retail execution and value;
productivity in everything we do; constructive
disruption across the value chain; and an agile,
accountable and empowered organization.
These are not independent strategic choices. They
reinforce and build on each other, and when executed
well, they lead to balanced top- and bottom-line
growth and value creation. There is still meaningful
opportunity for improvement and leverage in every
facet of this strategy, and we continue to work to
strengthen our execution of these choices.
A Portfolio of Superior,
Daily-Use Products
P&G has a focused portfolio of daily-use products
 — many providing cleaning, health and hygiene
benefits — in 10 categories where performance drives
brand choice: Fabric Care, Home Care, Baby Care,
Feminine Care, Family Care, Hair Care, Skin & Personal
Care, Oral Care, Personal Health Care and Grooming.
We know how to win in these categories — by delivering
irresistibly superior propositions to our consumers
and retail partners across product performance,
packaging, brand communication, retail execution
and value. Continued investment in these five vectors
of superiority is critical to drive sustainable business
growth. Even when our costs are rising sharply, we
will not diverge from this strategy, especially when
consumers are ever more focused on the performance
and value of the brands they choose.
Superiority to Win
with Consumers
We continue to raise the bar on all aspects of superiority 
 — product, package, brand communication, retail
execution and value — in all price tiers where we compete We are leveraging this superiority to grow markets,
and P&G’s share in them, as a way to sustainably build
the business. Creating new business is powerful with
our retail partners as we work to jointly create value.
Superiority is especially critical in an inflationary
environment. As consumers face increased pressure
on nearly every aspect of their household budgets,
we invest to deliver truly superior value through a
combination of price and product performance to
earn their loyalty every day. We are committed to keep
investing to strengthen the superiority of our brands
across innovation, supply chains and brand equity to
deliver superior value for consumers.
Ongoing Productivity
The strategic need for investment to strengthen the
long-term health and competitiveness of our brands,
the short-term need to manage through significant
cost increases, and the ongoing need to drive balanced
top- and bottom-line growth, including margin
expansion, underscore the importance of productivity.
We have developed a strong productivity muscle
over the last decade as we delivered two $10 billion
savings programs. Productivity is part of our DNA
now, which will help us address some of the challenges
we face. We remain fully committed to cost and cash
productivity in all facets of our business. No area of cost
is left untouched.
For example, as COVID-19 supply chain challenges ease
and we reach a better balance of supply and demand,
we will have an increased opportunity to implement
cost savings projects in our manufacturing operations.
As we leverage digital tools and automation, there
will be more opportunities to focus employees on the
higher-order work of serving consumers. And, as we
continue to integrate data and analytics and artificial
intelligence, brand teams will be working to make
our marketing investments even more efficient and
effective to deliver improved demand creation at equal
or lower cost.
Each business is driving productivity up and down
their income statement and across their balance sheet,
and we remain fully committed to productivity as a
core driver of balanced top- and bottom-line growth
and strong cash generation. We cannot let up here.
Productivity will remain a significant part of our work,
especially now. A Constructive
Disruption Mindset
Success in our highly competitive industry
also requires agility that comes with a mindset
of constructive disruption — a willingness to
change, adapt and create new trends and
technologies that will shape our industry
for the future. A mindset of constructive
disruption is even more important in this
challenging environment.
A good example of constructive disruption
in a category is Dawn Powerwash Dish
Spray, which addresses the changing habit of
washing dishes as you go instead of waiting
until the end of a meal. The product enables
direct application of activated suds to dishes
to speed up the entire process, saving people
not only time but also water.
Another example is how we continue to
reinvent brand building, including how
we reach consumers more effectively and
efficiently. Pampers, our largest and most
global brand, is relatively unique in that
its primary audience is narrow: parents of
children at diapering age. To reach these
parents more precisely, Pampers created the
Pampers Rewards app so parents can receive
helpful information, tips, deals and rewards.
With this app, Pampers was able to build
smart audiences to reach parents at different
stages — like newborns, crawling and potty
training — with more precise advertising
specifically designed for each media platform,
increasing the brand’s reach, effectiveness
and efficiency, while driving cost savings.
Success in our highly competitive industry
requires the agility that comes with a
mindset of constructive disruption — An Empowered, Agile and
Accountable Organization
We strive for an empowered, agile and accountable
organization with little overlap or redundancy — 
flowing to new demands and seamlessly supporting
each other, through a culture of equality and inclusion,
to deliver against our priorities around the world.
P&G is organized around five industry-based
sector business units (SBUs). These five sectors
manage our 10 product categories, with full sales,
profit, cash and value creation responsibility for our
largest and most profitable markets — called Focus
Markets — accounting for about 80% of Company
sales and about 90% of after-tax profit.
Enterprise Markets, which represent the rest of the
world, are a separate unit with sales, profit and value
creation responsibility. Over the last several years,
we have been growing both top and bottom line in
nearly all of these markets, which are important to
the future of P&G.
The best proof that this organization design is working
is the growth of our largest and most profitable market,
North America, whose growth has accelerated since
we put this design in place. Organic sales in North
America have increased from an average of +2% the
three years prior to the design change to +8% in the
three years since.
This structure, and its resulting organizational speed
and focus, has also allowed us to manage through
the challenges and headwinds we are experiencing.
We continue to believe that this structure — with the
SBUs squarely concentrated on Focus Markets and
managing Enterprise Markets as a separate operating
unit — is the best way to navigate successfully through
the increasingly dynamic world in which we live.

Strengthening Our Strategy
One of the most important things about our strategy 
 — portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive
disruption, and an empowered, agile and accountable
organization — is that it is inherently dynamic, not static.
It requires being responsive to changing consumer
needs and habits. It demands we serve evolving
customer needs in rapidly transforming channels.
Going forward, we have identified four areas to be
even more deliberate and intentional about pursuing
to further strengthen the execution of our strategy.
The first is Supply. We are improving our supply chain
capacity, agility, cost efficiency and resilience for a new
reality and a new age. The capability investments we
made prior to COVID-19 to improve our manufacturing
and distribution networks in the U.S. and Europe
helped us to manage through the last few years with
relatively few prolonged issues. We are already making
the next round of investments needed to ensure
we have multiple qualified suppliers for key inputs,
sufficient manufacturing capacity to satisfy growing
demand and flexibility to meet the changing needs
of all types of retailers.
The second area is Environmental Sustainability.
We are integrating sustainability into our product,
packaging and supply chain innovation work to develop
irresistibly superior offerings for consumers that are
better for the environment. For example, our new
cardboard packaging on Gillette razors reduces plastic
packaging and offers a noticeably superior experience
for consumers at the first and second moments of
truth. Another example is our new fully recyclable
paper packaging on our premium Always Cotton
Protection pads recently launched in Germany. One
more example is cold-water washing with Tide and
Ariel. When people turn their wash cycles to cold, they
can save up to 90% of the energy used on every load
of laundry, while saving money. They also get greater
satisfaction because their colors look brighter, and their
clothes look newer longer. Better for the consumer,
better for our planet.
Third, we are increasing our Digital Acumen to drive
consumer and customer preference, reduce cost and
enable rapid and efficient decision making. Increased
The Procter & Gamble Company • vii
digitization of our manufacturing lines, more use
of artificial intelligence and more use of blockchain
technology are not ends unto themselves. They are
tools we can use to delight consumers and customers.
Fourth, a Superior Employee Value Equation for all
gender identities, races, ethnicities, sexual orientations,
ages, and abilities — for all roles — to ensure we
continue to attract, retain and develop the best talent.
By definition, this must include equality. To deliver
a superior employee value equation, there must be
something in it for everyone.
These are not new or separate strategies. They are
necessary elements of focus in continuing to build
superiority, in reducing cost to enable investment and
value creation, and in strengthening our organization.
They are part of the constructive disruption we must
continue to lead.
Meeting Consumer, Customer,
Employee, Societal and
Investor Needs
In the ever more complex world we live in, it is not
just top and bottom line that must be delivered
and balanced. We must endeavor to deliver against
the needs of an increasing number of constituents.
This is especially true in our efforts in Environmental,
Social and Governance (ESG), where consumer,
customer, employee, society and shareowner
expectations are growing As I shared earlier, our consumers increasingly rely on
us to deliver superior solutions that are sustainable.
Our world requires that we do our part in this regard.
This challenge is also an opportunity to extend our
margin of superiority, further grow categories, and
create more value, all while improving our own
environmental impact, enabling consumers to
reduce their footprint, and helping society solve
some of the most pressing global challenges. Our Community Impact work helps improve lives
for people in difficult times by providing clean water
and donations of product, time and money to those
affected by natural disasters and crises around the
world. It is also part of what employees are proud
of and value in P&G. The ability to do good for the
communities we live and work in also helps us
attract and retain the best talent.
We know we increase our chances of winning when
we have an equal, diverse and inclusive culture that
gives life to the best thoughts and ideas — a culture
where everyone can succeed and is able to be their best.
Externally, we support equality and inclusion efforts
with our business partners and in the communities
where we live and work because it is not only the right
thing to do, but it also can improve income and wealth
equity for more people, creating more purchasing
power, which drives market growth.
Our foundation is our Purpose, Values and Principles,
which set a high standard for each P&G person. High
standards are good. They require that we hold ourselves
and each other accountable for results and, equally
important, for how we achieve those results. Last
year, we added an ESG factor to our annual incentive
compensation program for our senior executives as
a demonstration of our commitment to near-term
progress toward our long-term ESG goals.
Serving and balancing the needs of consumers,
customers, employees, society and shareowners
will not be easy, but it is necessary — and those
that do it best, as I expect we will, should thrive Looking Forward
The integrated strategies we have outlined here
were delivering strong results before the pandemic.
They served us well during the more recent volatile
times. They remain the right strategic choices to drive
balanced growth and value creation. We endeavor
to step forward into the challenges we face, not back,
growing through near-term challenges, while serving
consumers and communities. We are doing this in
our interest, in society’s interest and in the interest
of our long-term shareowners.
Confidence in our future success is rooted in my
confidence in P&G people. Every day, P&G people
demonstrate their commitment to our Purpose,
Values and Principles, their high motivation to win,
their personal accountability to winning results,
and their strong focus on sustained excellence in
everything they do — serving consumers, serving
customers and delivering for shareowners.",
52,General Electric,Industrial Machinery,"172,000",76555,104231,225,0.3,GE,"Dear Fellow Shareholder, 2022 was a year that propelled GE forward. Our changes and achievements were both small—one improvement to one process at one site—and big— successfully launching GE HealthCare as an independent company. Each was rooted in kaizen, “change to make it better,” and delivered on our purpose to build a world that works. We entered the year with a clear strategy for GE’s path ahead and faced a world that looked quite different from what we expected. We experienced inflationary pressures not seen since the 1980s, geopolitical conflict, global supply chain challenges, and an enduring pandemic. In these times, we focused on “controlling the controllable,” as my mentor at Danaher and GE alumnus George Sherman used to say, and by doing so, we advanced our plans to create independent, industry-leading public companies. We maintained our day-to-day focus of meeting customer commitments and made significant operational progress while delivering strong financial performance. GE ended the year with solid revenue growth and margin expansion, and $4.8 billion of free cash flow.* GE Aerospace led the way with order and revenue growth above 20% for the year, and Power delivered doubledigit order growth organically and achieved high-single-digit margins. And today, excluding GE HealthCare, higher-margin and more resilient services represent an even larger part of our portfolio at approximately 60% of our revenue. This was all made possible by our team’s embedding lean more deeply, putting our customers first, and embracing a culture of humility, transparency, and focus. At GE, we strive to make every hour of every day, every day of every week, every week of every month count, and I couldn’t be prouder of the way our employees have delivered for the company and for each other. * Non-GAAP Financial Measure GE 2022 ANNUAL REPORT | 1 Solid Foundation “Step by step and the bird makes its nest,” Abdelhamid Chemami, Operations and Maintenance Specialist at Gas Power, wrote to me in November of 2022 as GE marked the one-year anniversary of the announcement of our spin plans. This message stuck with me. Throughout our journey over the past four years—step by step—we have built a stronger GE. Our first priority was to reduce our debt load, and we have done so by over $100 billion since 2018—no small feat. Often there were hard decisions to make, but those choices have given us optionality to play more offense both organically and inorganically. Today our balance sheet is solid, and we are operating from a position of strength. We are also focused on changing the way we work. A lean mindset focuses on safety, quality, delivery, and cost (SQDC)—in that order— and gives us the tools and instincts to make the right decisions and necessary trade-offs. By deeply embedding lean principles and tools, we are creating a problem-solving culture and serving our customers better. While developing a lean mindset takes many years, we are gaining ground. At our GE Aerospace site in Greenville, South Carolina, our team performs complex machining operations and detailed inspections on high-pressure turbine blades. With a clear focus on reducing blade delivery lead time, the team created standard lines, which in turn improved part flow. This has reduced lead time by more than 10 days, with a clear target for more reduction to come, improving our operations for our customers and reducing inventory. This is just one of the countless examples of effective utilization of lean across GE. Our progress on these priorities has made our foundation strong enough to launch three companies. More than a year after this announcement, the logic behind—and our conviction in—our historic transformation has only strengthened. Along the way, the feedback from our customers, investors, employees, and other stakeholders has been overwhelmingly positive. Let’s take a closer look at our businesses. GE Aerospace At GE Aerospace, we have a tremendously talented team, a highly differentiated product and technology portfolio, leading positions in attractive commercial and military sectors, and a bold vision for the future of flight. In 2022, nearly 3 billion people flew with our technology under wing. We have nearly 41,000 commercial engines1 at work in more than 70% of global airlines, and a diverse portfolio of more than 26,000 military engines. We take that responsibility seriously, living our purpose to invent the future of flight, lift people up, and bring them home safely. A highlight in 2022 was being with the team and our customers at the Farnborough International Airshow—the industry’s first major gathering since the pandemic began. As I looked across the tarmac and saw so many of our engines under wing, I felt a deep sense of pride and appreciation—for our employees who make it possible and for our customers who put their trust in us. GE Aerospace’s Tatum Ross is a Lead Manufacturing Engineer in Evendale, Ohio, seen here with a Passport engine. A WINNING VALUE PROPOSITION It’s now been three years since the start of the pandemic, and the world is eager to travel. The commercial market recovery continues, and we expect total departures to return to 2019 levels in late 2023. GE Aerospace is uniquely positioned to serve this market as customers expand and upgrade their fleets. Today we have new engines in each market segment that offer double-digit fuel burn reduction, lowering one of our customers’ greatest variable costs. In 2022, CFM International, our joint venture with Safran, was selected by Delta Air Lines to deliver 200 CFM LEAP-1B engines to power its new fleet of Boeing 737-10 aircraft, with options for up to 60 additional engines. We also signed an order with Qatar Airways for GE9X engines to propel up to 50 of its Boeing 777-8 Freighters, as well as a services agreement to cover the maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) of these engines. Commercial departures are a leading indicator of shop visit demand, which we expect to grow by double digits in the year ahead. We have a diversified services portfolio with an extensive MRO network, providing us with full flexibility to meet customer needs. This year, both Delta TechOps and Air France Industries KLM Engineering & We invent the future of flight, lift people up, and bring them home safely. 1 Including GE and its joint venture partners 2 | GE 2022 ANNUAL REPORT WE RISE TO THE CHALLENGE OF BUILDING A WORLD THAT WORKS Maintenance joined the global network of LEAP MRO facilities as we work to expand shop visit capacity for the rapidly growing fleet. This is one of many highlights of how we are continuing to serve our customers. On the military side, national defense budgets are growing. In the U.S. alone, the Department of Defense increased its fiscal 2023 budget by 4%. Our business is focused on winning core platforms. Our groundbreaking XA100 fighter engine is the first and only adaptive cycle engine to successfully complete testing with the U.S. Air Force, confirming our ability to deliver 30% more range and twice the thermal management capability of the incumbent engine on the F-35 aircraft. In the face of rising geopolitical threats, we stand ready to bring this innovative engine that pairs power with efficiency to the F-35 fighter jet before the end of this decade. In the rotorcraft segment, we began testing our T901 turboshaft engine, selected by the U.S. Army to replace our ubiquitous T700 powering the Black Hawk and Apache helicopters as well as the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft. And we continue to expand our international efforts with allied nations, for example powering South Korea’s KF-21 Boramae fighter with our F414 engines. DELIVERING STRONG GROWTH IN 2022 Delivering on this unprecedented ramp starts with our team. The GE Aerospace leadership team balances unparalleled experience with fresh perspective, with nearly half of the leaders new to their roles in the past year. We see an opportunity to accelerate our lean progress both within GE Aerospace and with our partners, suppliers, and customers. We have improved our operating rhythms, moving to a more frequent weekly and monthly cadence for each of our P&Ls. This helps us manage the business in real time and deliver better, faster, and more efficiently in a highly dynamic environment. To help improve engine delivery, for example, we reprioritized 20% of our existing engineers to solve problems closer to the point of impact and quicker through daily management. As a result, engine output was up year over year. This year, we have taken steps to vertically integrate our P&Ls further, driving focus within the portfolio. For example, in our Commercial Engines and Services business, we are increasingly running our product lines as their own P&Ls, aligned with how our customers work with us. And we moved the Electric Power and Avionics teams to our Military business, aligning P&Ls with a strong military customer base. This granularity is improving our process capabilities, especially within our supply chain, and driving accountability closer to the customer. Taken together, lean and decentralization are making a real impact. For the year, revenue was up 23% organically,* driven by Commercial Services, with internal shop visits up over 20%. Margins were 18.3%, and free cash flow* was $4.9 billion, driven by earnings and working capital.

SHAPING THE FUTURE OF FLIGHT GE Aerospace has a bright future and, as the company that defines flight for the next generation, we have not taken our eye off our mission to create a smarter and more efficient future of flight. We are continuing our efforts to support use of sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, which is vital to enabling the airline industry to meet its decarbonization goals. The revolutionary CFM RISE Technology Demonstration Program is the manifestation of the deep commitment GE and Safran share for achieving ambitious goals for a sustainable future. Leveraging an open fan architecture, hybrid electric capability, and key materials technologies like additive manufacturing and ceramic matrix composites (CMCs), this program is aiming to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by more than 20% compared with today’s most efficient engines. In 2022, we announced a new flight test program for a hydrogen combustion engine and an open fan flight test demonstration, both with Airbus. In hybrid electric, we are working with NASA and Boeing to fly a megawatt-class hybrid electric system. And our Avio Aero team will lead a European project to test a hybrid electric motor powered by hydrogen fuel cells. Overall, GE Aerospace is an exceptional franchise. The quality of our technology and product development plans, the energy and collaboration of our team, and our unique positioning as the industry’s largest and youngest fleet give us confidence that this business will generate significant value for decades to come. We are united by a single, urgent purpose to electrify and decarbonize the planet: because together, we have the energy to change the world. We are not only building a healthier future but living our purpose to create a world where healthcare has no limits. * Non-GAAP Financial Measure GE 2022 ANNUAL REPORT | 3 H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. CEO, GE Aerospace “GE Aerospace has a bright future, defining flight for the next generation.” Peter Arduini CEO, GE HealthCare “As a new standalone company, GE HealthCare continues to deliver on its purpose to create a world where healthcare has no limits.” Scott Strazik CEO, GE Vernova “Our strategic imperative to both electrify and decarbonize the world is a challenge that GE Vernova, our portfolio of energy businesses, was made to meet.” GE Vernova GE’s portfolio of energy businesses, now called GE Vernova, is helping the energy sector solve for sustainability, reliability, and affordability. With approximately 54,000 wind turbines and 7,000 gas turbines, GE Vernova helps generate 30% of the world’s electricity and has a meaningful role to play in the energy transition. Our experienced leadership team brings industry expertise to drive business improvement and we are excited about its planned future as a standalone company. Wind Technician Sage Thill performs a safety check as he prepares to perform maintenance on a 2 MW wind turbine at Pattern’s Western Spirit wind farm in New Mexico. AT THE CENTER OF A DYNAMIC AND GROWING MARKET GE Vernova sits at the center of a dynamic and growing market. External catalysts, including U.S. climate legislation and constraints in the European energy market, are increasing investment in new decarbonization technologies, an area where GE Vernova’s portfolio is uniquely positioned to lead. These catalysts also improve the longterm economic profile of the underlying businesses. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act is game-changing. It provides the certainty and stability our Renewable Energy customers need to make long-term investments, especially in onshore wind. GE Vernova’s decarbonization technologies are aligned with the $370 billion in tax credits the bill provides. Additionally, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provides at least $65 billion for investment in grid, nuclear, and breakthrough technologies. With Europe seeking to address energy security concerns, there is renewed urgency to reduce emissions and make energy more resilient, and there is pragmatism in doing so. The new EU taxonomy, for example, reinforces the important roles of gas and nuclear alongside renewables. Our customers in the region are engaging our full technology roadmap, including wind, hydropower, gas fuel blends, and grid. Global gas generation and utilization continues to grow, with strength in Europe and the U.S. While we saw volatility in gas prices and availability this year, gas remains a fuel of choice on dispatch curves globally to meet growing electricity demand, and we continue to plan for a gas turbine market of 25 to 30 gigawatts annually. MAKING PROGRESS & PREPARING TO SPIN While these trends provide tailwinds for GE Vernova over time, external pressures faced in 2022 impacted business performance. Power delivered solid performance. Gas Power grew, driven by services strength and aeroderivative momentum. We continued to advance our turnaround at Power Conversion, focus on services at Steam Power, and deliver innovation at GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy. This progress enabled us to deliver double-digit orders growth organically, with growth across each business, achieve high-single-digit margins with significant margin expansion, and improve free cash flow* of A STRONG RECORD OF LEADERSHIP 4 * Non-GAAP Financial Measure | GE 2022 ANNUAL REPORT $1.9 billion for the year. Services continues to be a major driver of our business performance and improvement, and we are well positioned for continued growth with our expanded HA fleet. Scott Strazik, CEO of GE Vernova, who successfully led the Gas Power business, is now running a similar strategy at Renewable Energy. Onshore Wind is an $8 billion annual revenue business, where we have added over 40 gigawatts to the grid. However, like most of the industry, this business has faced challenges due to the U.S. production tax credit (PTC) lapse, which reduced 2022 demand. Additionally, cost has been a challenge, with inflation and rapid innovation straining quality. We moved quickly to enhance product quality and reduce costs. We deployed corrective measures in our existing fleet to increase availability; reduced fixed costs, which included the difficult but necessary step of decreasing our global headcount; and are more selective on the projects we bid on to ensure we’re executing profitably. Offshore Wind is transitioning to approximately $500 million in annual revenue and growing. We installed and commissioned 80 turbines for EDF on schedule, and now our focus shifts to our 7-gigawatt Haliade-X backlog. Grid is a $3 billion annual revenue business, where market demand in automation and hardware remains strong. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we saw a major inflection point—Grid was profitable for the first time since 2018, reflecting our restructuring and selectivity efforts, and orders also grew significantly. Lean continues to generate new opportunities for sustained improvement across GE Vernova and, in turn, for our customers. For example, Gas Power Services’ business playbook for planned maintenance outage events, called Live Outage, hosts all critical content and standard procedures that field crews need at their fingertips. Initially launched in the United States, at power plants powered by GE 7F gas turbines, it helped complete outages safely with a substantial reduction in cycle time, getting our customers’ turbine back online sooner. In 2022, Live Outage expanded to the Europe and the Middle East for GE 9F turbines. LEADING A NEW ERA OF ENERGY The planned spin-off of GE Vernova comes as the world faces a 50% increase in electricity demand over the next two decades. Against this backdrop, the strategic imperative to electrify and decarbonize the world is a challenge that GE Vernova was made to meet. In the U.S., Power secured an order from Kindle Energy in Louisiana to provide H-Class power generation equipment. Initially fueled by natural gas, it has the ability to use up to 50% hydrogen by volume. In Vietnam, Power secured its first new 9HA.02 combined-cycle power plant order, which is expected to improve the reliability and stability of the energy grid to support renewables penetration. Renewable Energy, along with Invenergy, completed the largest wind farm in North America in a single phase. Notably, the Traverse Wind Energy Center is powered by more than 350 of our 2-megawatt platform turbines. Hydro Solutions signed orders with a total generating capacity of 7 gigawatts in 2022, and GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy is working with several customers, including Ontario Power Generation in Canada, to deploy advanced nuclear technologies like our BWRX-300 small modular reactor, which produces no carbon during operation. I’m excited about our plans for the future of GE Vernova. Combining Renewable Energy, Power, and Digital into one business brings together unique experience, talented people, and a pioneering spirit that can power the future while also helping decarbonize the world. GE HealthCare Big picture, GE HealthCare operates in an attractive, growing market, fueled by global trends, including the aging population, chronic disease, and the rise of the middle class in developing markets. The healthcare industry is also facing challenges in improving productivity, harnessing patient data more effectively, and extending care out of the hospital to alternative care sites. There is no medical technology company better suited to address these challenges. GE HealthCare is a new company, and one with extensive scale— serving 1 billion patients across 2 billion procedures a year—and profound global reach, with almost 60% of annual sales outside the U.S. It also has more than 4 million equipment installations, and upgrades to the fleet help the business create value and stay close to customers. Investing $1 billion in research and development annually, GE HealthCare remains at the forefront of innovation.

With the spin, GE effectively distributed a $30 billion dividend in the form of GE HealthCare shares, while retaining an approximately 19.9% stake in the company. And shareholders in the new GE HealthCare are already seeing value unlocked as the independent company embarks on its important mission to create a world where healthcare has no limits. Creating Value Today & Tomorrow GE Board Member and former U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter sadly passed away in October. We miss him every day and again express our deepest sympathies to his wife and family. Ash once said to me, “I like the ethos of GE,” and how GE sits on the same side of the table with customers when it comes to technology and efficient production. I couldn’t agree more. We approach our work with our customers as “one team with one fight,” as Ash would describe it. That was as true this past year as it was for the more than 130 years that came before it, and we will carry that ethos into our future. 2022 marked the beginning of a new era for GE. One where we are unleashing our full potential as three independent industry leaders. Creating a smarter and more efficient future of flight, driving decarbonization through the energy transition, and enabling precision care are big challenges, not for the faint of heart. I know our teams are ready to deliver.",

During fiscal 2022, we undertook a review of strategic alternatives aimed at enhancing our growth and maximizing stockholder value. This review led to our definitive merger agreement with The Kroger Co. in October 2022. Bringing together Kroger and Albertsons Cos. will allow our neighborhood grocery stores to serve more than 85 million households with fresher food, faster. By combining two purpose-driven companies, we will be able to secure jobs, including union jobs, provide new career opportunities for our associates and build on our shared commitment to supporting local communities. While the transaction is being reviewed by regulators, we remain focused on our performance as a stand-alone public company and continue to execute our Customers for Life strategy. We are also focused on our purpose, to bring people together around the joys of food and to inspire well-being. We are proud of the way our team continued to take care of our customers and serve our communities in fiscal 2022, while driving strong operating and financial performance. Our results for fiscal 2022 exceeded our expectations and speak to the progress we have made, with identical sales increasing by 6.9% and digital sales increasing by 28%. Total sales were $77.6 billion, net income reached $1.5 billion, or $2.27 per share, Adjusted net income was $2.0 billion, or $3.37 per share, and Adjusted EBITDA was $4.7 billion. We also returned $4.2 billion to our stockholders this fiscal year, including a special cash dividend of $6.85 per share, which was paid in January 2023. Throughout the year, we consistently executed against our four strategic priorities: Deepening our Digital Connection and Engagement with our Customers – We increased loyalty membership to more than 34 million customers, acquired new e-commerce customers, added to Fresh Pass enrollment, and increased Drive Up and Go service to 2,150 stores. We also focused on achieving home deliveries within two hours or less, which is now available to 80% of our households. Differentiating our Store Experience – We enhanced merchandising with displays that allow for easy meal ingredient assembly and the addition of grab-and-go sections. We implemented AI technology for missed scans at self-checkout to make it faster and easier for our customers to complete an error free check out. We also improved in-store production systems, helping to improve the scheduling of shifts to drive a better associate experience and higher customer satisfaction, while ensuring freshness and improved in-stock conditions. Enhancing What We Offer – We expanded our Own Brand product portfolio with 375 new items and elevated our distinctiveness in Fresh, tailoring our selection based on demographics. We also extended our Ready Meals program to over 1,100 stores, and enhanced capabilities in pricing and assortment. Modernizing our Capabilities – We improved our supply chain through automation and began the rollout of a new enterprise warehouse management system. We have also built the Albertsons Media Collective, an easy-to-use, transparent and modern media collective platform that has transformed us into a leader in client advocacy, innovation, and measurement capability. We also modernized the network connectivity in our stores and deployed technology in produce departments to enhance freshness and reduce waste. In addition, we completed migration to the public cloud and enhanced the use of advanced data and analytic capabilities throughout the business. Albertsons Companies 1 2023 Proxy Statement Table of Contents We are embedding ESG in everything we do and continue to make progress toward our goals. These commitments include achieving our carbon emission reduction goals (approved by the Science Based Targets initiative) by 2030, achieving net zero emissions in our own operations by 2040, and zero food waste going into landfill by 2030, as well as increasing diverse representation in management and enabling the donation of 1 billion meals by 2030. Finally, I want to recognize the approximately 290,000 associates who have made our success possible through their commitment to meeting the needs of our customers and communities.

In 2021, the Board remained focused on ensuring that we are prepared for uncertain economic conditions resulting from global unrest, the Company’s emergence from the COVID-19 pandemic and adaptation to more flexible and agile ways of working, and enhancing readiness and resilience in the face of ever-increasing cybersecurity threats. That preparation has paid off. The Company has delivered another year of strong financial results for investors, while continuing to innovate and develop agile and digital tools to better serve customers. Employees recently returned to their offices under a Future Work model designed to provide flexibility while also promoting productivity. And MetLife accelerated efforts to prove itself as a champion of diversity and inclusion, and a responsible steward of the environment. Management has done an outstanding job executing on each of these, and many other essential elements of the Company strategy, to optimize the value of your investment. The Board remains committed to ensuring that we are prepared for whatever may come next. Last September, the Board held a full-day strategy session to assess the execution of the Next Horizon strategy and concluded that the Company was on track. Directors also participated in an intensive cyber resilience and crisis management simulation session, including a simulation to demonstrate MetLife’s response readiness in the event of a cyber-crisis incident. Perhaps the most critical way that the Board prepares for the future is by securing the right skills and experience in the boardroom to face the challenges that lie ahead. Recently, we were fortunate to welcome Carla Harris, a strong motivational leader with extensive experience in investments and financial services, and the perfect addition to our Board. Finally, I thank you, our shareholders, for your continued investment in MetLife. I encourage you to read this Proxy Statement and the instructions on the pages that follow to learn more about the Company and how to cast your votes and participate in our virtual annual meeting of shareholders. Your vote is important to us – even if you do not attend the meeting, please be sure that you vote your shares. Sincerely,",
55,Goldman Sachs Group,Commercial Banks,"48,500",68711,113964,11261,16.4,GS,"Fellow Shareholders: In January 2020, I stood in the auditorium of our New York headquarters at 200 West Street and kicked off our first Investor Day. Back then, our leadership team and I laid out a comprehensive strategy to strengthen and grow the firm: First, we would invest in our core businesses. Second, we would pursue four growth initiatives: asset management, wealth management, transaction banking and consumer banking. And third, we would run the firm more efficiently. In addition, for the first time, we set public, firmwide financial targets to help investors hold us accountable. In February 2023, we took another step on our journey when we held our second Investor Day, and as I said then, it has certainly been an interesting three years. Back in January 2020, nobody would have imagined that just a few weeks later a pandemic would break out and there would be such disruption in the global economy. Even today, we’re operating in an uncertain environment. The war in Ukraine has roiled energy markets, and an increase in inflation has triggered monetary tightening. But through it all, we’ve stayed focused on shareholders, and I’m proud of what we’ve accomplished. Since our first Investor Day, our total shareholder return is 60 percent, outperforming our peer average meaningfully.1 Our book value per share is up by nearly 40 percent, roughly twice that of our closest competitor.1 Our earnings per share is up by over 40 percent. We’ve returned nearly $18 billion in capital to common shareholders. And our average returns over the past three years are in line with ANNUAL REPORT 2022 LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS John Waldron President and Chief Operating Officer David Solomon Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Denis Coleman Chief Financial Officer 3 “Being exceptional is not a given, but we always learn and adapt.” our current targets of 14–16 percent return on equity (ROE) and 15–17 percent return on tangible equity (ROTE).2 When you look at our 2022 results specifically, there’s no question that the operating environment was challenging. The same business mix that did so well in 2021 faced headwinds, such as low capital markets issuance activity and falling equity and fixed income asset prices. At the same time, we continued to make strategic investments in our acquisitions and technology that, though important to the firm’s longterm strength, weighed on our financial performance in the short run. Despite those difficulties, we delivered for shareholders in 2022. Net revenues were $47.4 billion, net earnings were $11.3 billion and diluted earnings per common share were $30.06. ROE was 10.2 percent and ROTE2 was 11.0 percent. We also grew our book value per share by 6.7 percent and continued to make significant progress on our strategic evolution. As a result, in a macro environment where equity issuance hit a nearly two-decade low, we performed better than we would have three years ago. In the pages that follow, we lay out in detail the state of our franchise as well as the progress we’ve made in our businesses, and as you’ll see, our strategy is a reflection of our purpose: We aspire to be the world’s most exceptional financial institution, united by our core values of partnership, client service, integrity and excellence. Being exceptional is not a given, but we always learn and adapt. We are constantly focused on outperforming for our clients. And what’s most exceptional about our firm is our people. As I travel around the world meeting with clients, I’m often told how talented our people are. We couldn’t have anticipated all the challenges David Solomon $47.4B 10.2% $11.3B 11.0% $30.06 Financial Performance Net revenues ROE Net earnings ROTE2 Diluted earnings per common share ANNUAL REPORT 2022 LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS 5 we’d face over the past three years, and yet our people met them all with hard work, creativity and determination. I’m grateful to call them my colleagues. I’m also fortunate to work with a leadership team that is laser-focused on executing our strategy: our president and chief operating officer, John Waldron; our chief financial officer, Denis Coleman; and our entire Management Committee. The path ahead is never certain, and there will be plenty of challenges along the way, but we head into 2023 energized, excited and determined to deliver for shareholders. One Goldman Sachs At the heart of our strategy is a focus on clients. We believe that serving our clients exceptionally well will both strengthen our franchise and deliver returns for our shareholders. As a result, in 2019, we started a pilot program that we believed would help demonstrate that commitment: One Goldman Sachs. One Goldman Sachs is now the organizational philosophy that underpins how we cover our clients in an increasingly complex world. It puts clients at the center of everything we do. It brings to bear our intellectual capital and expertise across all our businesses to serve our global client franchise in a more integrated and comprehensive manner. Today, we have partners who are responsible for owning the entire firmwide relationship with One Goldman Sachs clients, and as part of that, they are responsible for building dedicated teams that bring together the relevant experts and thought leaders across the firm to serve the client. One Goldman Sachs is highly accretive to multiple parts of our business and, more importantly, it’s highly accretive to our clients, who get the best of Goldman Sachs. One Goldman Sachs has expanded beyond a pilot program. We believe this ethos is applicable and extensible to a much broader set of clients. Strategic Reorganization In December 2022, building off our renewed commitment to client centricity, we reorganized the firm into three segments: 1) Global Banking & Markets; 2) Asset & Wealth Management; and 3) Platform Solutions, into which we have integrated two lines of businesses: Transaction banking and Consumer platforms, which consists of our consumer card partnerships and GreenSky. We saw this as the logical next step in our strategic journey to building a more durable firm that generates higher returns through the cycle. We are now reporting our results under our new structure, and we have also announced three key execution priorities: 1) maximizing wallet share and growing financing activities in GBM; 2) growing management and other fees in AWM; and 3) scaling Platform Solutions to deliver profitability. We believe we’re now well positioned to execute our strategy, capitalize on our strengths and achieve our execution priorities in all three of our segments. 1 2 3 Maximizing wallet share and growing financing activities in Global Banking & Markets Growing management and other fees in Asset & Wealth Management Scaling Platform Solutions to deliver profitability Our Three Key Execution Priorities ANNUAL REPORT 2022 LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS Asset & Wealth Management In Asset & Wealth Management, we’ve taken several disparate businesses inside the firm and combined them into one powerful platform. Today, we are a top 5 global active asset manager6 and a top 5 global alternatives manager6 with a premier wealth management franchise. We now have more than $2.5 trillion in assets under supervision (AUS). We had a record year in alternatives fundraising in 2022, with $72 billion raised across our franchise. Overall, we’ve raised nearly $180 billion since 2019, making real progress toward our revised target of $225 billion. Of that $72 billion in alternatives, $27 billion came through our wealth platform. And we now have loan penetration7 with approximately 30 percent of our U.S. private wealth clients, leaving us plenty of room for growth. Our total client assets8 in Wealth management stand at more than $1 trillion. In 2022, our Asset & Wealth Management business generated net revenues of $13.4 billion, a 39 percent decline from 2021. A steep drop in the net revenues related to Equity and Debt investments offset an additional $1 billion of Management and other fees and a strong increase in Private banking and lending net revenues. Full-year Management and other fees were $8.8 billion, putting us well on track to hit our 2024 target of more than $10 billion. Platform Solutions In 2022, we decided to significantly narrow our ambitions for our consumer strategy. Now we have a smaller set of emerging businesses. We are working to drive them to profitability, and we’re also considering strategic alternatives for our Consumer platforms. Segment Performance Global Banking & Markets Global Banking & Markets is an extraordinary franchise. We’ve been #1 in global completed M&A for 23 of the last 24 years,3 and once again this year we were the advisor of choice. We were also #2 in equity and equity-related underwriting as well as in high-yield debt underwriting. And yet, over the past three years, we’ve seen significant growth. We’ve increased wallet share by 370 basis points.4 We’ve increased our financing activities in FICC and Equities at a 16 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) to more than $7 billion in net revenues for 2022. And we’re now ranked in the top 3 with 77 of the top 100 institutional clients across FICC and Equities, up from a base of 51 at our first Investor Day.5 We had a very good business and we’ve made it better. In 2022, GBM generated revenues of $32.5 billion, a 12 percent decline from 2021, as significantly higher FICC net revenues were more than offset by a steep decline in Investment banking fees. Advisory net revenues, however, were $4.7 billion, the second highest in our history. 7 ANNUAL REPORT 2022 LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS Firmwide Expenses Total operating expenses for the year were $31.2 billion, down by 2 percent from 2021. Compensation and benefits expenses fell by 15 percent, despite a 10 percent increase in headcount, and were largely offset by higher non-compensation expenses. The increase in non-compensation expenses was primarily related to acquisitions, transaction-based costs and continued investments in technology. In addition, client-related market development costs were higher following lower levels during the pandemic. We remain highly focused on operating efficiency. We are actively engaged in expense mitigation efforts as we look to appropriately calibrate the firm for the operating environment. Balance Sheet Our balance sheet ended the year at $1.4 trillion, down by $114 billion versus the third quarter and relatively flat year over year as we focused on actively managing our resources. Deposits ended the year at $387 billion, up by approximately $23 billion year over year, reflecting growth in private bank and consumer deposits and transaction banking deposits. At the end of the fourth quarter, our standardized CET1 ratio was 15.0 percent, up by 80 basis points year over year. This represents a 120-basispoint buffer to our new capital requirement of 13.8 percent in the beginning of 2023. We returned $6.7 billion to common shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $3.5 billion and common stock dividends of $3.2 billion. Focused on the Forward We believe our strategy positions us well to meet our financial targets through the cycle. And, while in tougher environments we may not hit our return targets, our actions over the past several years have raised the floor of our returns, while retaining the upside in more conducive markets and lowering the overall volatility. Across all our businesses, we are focused on the forward. The integration of our #1 Investment Banking franchise9 with our leading FICC and Equities businesses positions Global Banking & Markets to continue delivering strong returns. Now we are focused on capturing share, particularly in favorable environments, while maintaining resource discipline. The size, breadth and diversity of our mix of activities have made revenues relatively stable over time. Our share gains and higher financing revenues over the past few years have further increased durability. This is a great business, and we are performing for clients at the highest level. In Asset & Wealth Management, our franchise benefits from the Goldman Sachs ecosystem that gives clients access to a wide breadth of products and solutions as well as our unique market insight and expertise. We’re focused on investment performance and client experience to drive a more durable revenue stream from fees and Private banking and lending. We are keeping ourselves accountable with our new medium-term targets on revenue growth, margin and ROE. This is the 9 area where there is the most significant growth opportunity for us, and where we are already operating at scale. And in Platform Solutions, though this segment remains small in the context of the broader firm, we see potential in these emerging platforms. We believe these are attractive businesses that provide stable, more recurring revenue derived from net interest income and fees, and we offer innovative, tech-forward products for our end customers. Firmwide, we remain committed to delivering on our financial targets, and we are confident in our ability to do so, given the underlying strength of our franchise. In the past three years, our average ROE was 14.8 percent. This was in line with our targets and 320 basis points higher than the peer10 average. And, if you exclude the impact of litigation in 2020, our average ROE would have been roughly 130 basis points higher. As we look ahead, we are committed to making the firm more transparent and accountable to shareholders. This is just as important to us as our business level targets. We’ve made a conscious effort to be open and accessible, with enhanced disclosures, more frequent investor conferences and regular strategic updates. We’ve continued to lay out targets for our firm and our businesses, and we’ve provided robust disclosure of key performance indicators to measure our progress. We’ve also made important changes to better align employee incentives. All our Management Committee members receive 100 percent of their annual stock-based compensation in performance-based shares that are earned based on future results. This is intended specifically to enhance collaboration and align our entire leadership team with long-term shareholder value creation. Beyond that, many of our employees are shareholders as well. We are united in driving shareholder value. Our People In addition to serving our clients and delivering for shareholders, we’re also focused on taking care of our people. We have a longstanding commitment to recruiting, developing and promoting the best talent available with the widest range of backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. We have made headway with our diverse representation goals at the analyst, associate and vice president levels. We were proud that our 2022 partner class was the most diverse to date. That said, we still have much work to do to build and retain a pipeline of diverse leadership.

In 2023, we mark the 15th anniversary of Goldman Sachs 10,000 Women, our ongoing initiative to foster economic growth by providing women entrepreneurs around the world with a business and management education and access to capital. The 10,000 Women in-person business education program was launched in 2008, and in 2018, the curriculum was made available online through Coursera, further democratizing access. In 2014, in partnership with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), 10,000 Women launched a first-of-its-kind global finance facility, the Women Entrepreneurs Opportunity Facility, to enable access to capital for more women entrepreneurs. As of March 2023, the facility had reached more than 164,000 women entrepreneurs, eclipsing the 100,000 target set when the initiative was launched, and contributing to an over $4.5 billion increase in the volume of loans on-lent by financial institutions to women-owned businesses. Overall, Goldman Sachs 10,000 Women has reached more than 200,000 women from over 150 countries. Building on what we learned from 10,000 Women, in 2009 we launched our signature entrepreneurship initiative, Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses. Today, the program has served more than 13,600 small businesses in all 50 states through our education program, and it has also partnered with select Community Development Financial Institutions to provide loans to small businesses. In 2020, we launched a new advocacy initiative, Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Business Voices, to help small business owners in the U.S. advocate for policy changes that matter to them. In July 2022, we brought together more than 2,500 entrepreneurs at our summit in Washington, D.C. — the largest gathering of its kind — to hear from top business leaders, devise new strategies for business growth and meet with more than 300 members of Congress to call for policy action, specifically to modernize and reauthorize the Small Business Administration for the first time in more than 20 years. In 2021, we took what we had learned from both programs to launch our latest initiative, One Million Black Women. In the first two years, we’ve already seen progress and firmwide engagement. We’ve committed more than $1 billion of investment capital and more than $20 million in grant capital to 116 organizations, companies and projects, which puts us on track to directly impact the lives of more than 184,000 Black women and girls. Some examples include a growth equity investment in CareAcademy, a Black woman–led upskilling company; our Alternative Investment Management Black Equity Opportunities fund; and our people serving as executive coaches to Black women school principals through our partnership with New Leaders. From our experience, and with the guidance of our Advisory Council, we’ve learned that what we need most — more than good ideas — are partners. Only by combining our efforts can we hope to transform the economy we leave behind for the next generation. Sustainable Finance Another area where we’ve long been focused is sustainability. We have been a leading voice in the financial services industry addressing climate change and other critical environmental challenges going back to 2005, when we established our Environmental Policy Framework. In 2019, we set a target of $750 billion in financing, advisory and investing activity over the next 10 years across the themes of climate transition and inclusive growth. We have achieved approximately 55 percent of our target in three years. By connecting our experience as a financial institution with the insights gained through our work with clients and partners and our ongoing engagement with the public sector, we are enabling capital to move toward solutions that will help clients not only adapt but also take ownership to drive the transition to a low-carbon economy. At the same time, we cannot address market gaps at scale on our own, so we continue to identify strategic partners whose strengths and areas of focus complement our own. 13 ANNUAL REPORT 2022 LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS David Solomon Chairman and Chief Executive Officer The Path Ahead When you look at our strategy, our culture, our talent and our track record, I think we’re incredibly well positioned to serve our clients. We are stewards of their trust — a trust that has been built up over a very long period of time. Goldman Sachs has a deep history of working with clients who have had a huge impact on the world, and we work hard to uphold that tradition of exceptional client service every day. As we go forward, we are focused on the success of our clients and our franchise so we can deliver for shareholders. We’re working hard to raise the floor on returns and achieve our through-the-cycle targets. Our leadership is focused on our key priorities to make the firm stronger and more diversified. And I believe if we stay true to our core values, our strategy and our people, the best days for Goldman Sachs are yet to come.",
56,Sysco,Wholesalers: Food and Grocery,"70,510",68636,39202,1359,2,SYY,"Fellow Stockholders, As the global leader of foodservice distribution, we think of Sysco as being, in equal measure, a food sales and marketing company, as well as a supply chain company. To be successful in our industry, we must be innovators and strong operators in both food sales and supply chain. During fiscal year 2022, our Recipe for Growth strategy advanced our capabilities in both arenas, enabling our growth and strengthening our leadership position. Over the past couple of years, we have transformed Sysco from being the most efficient operator in our industry, to becoming a growth company. We remain the most profitable in our sector from an adjusted EBITDA margin perspective, and, we have added to that success the accelerant known as growth. We successfully grew our market share by more than a full point over the past calendar year. That success was driven by Sysco growing more than 1.3 times the U.S. industry at large in our fiscal year 2022. We are confident in our ability to continue growing faster than the industry, profitably. Why? We have a strategy that is focused on our customers and our associates. We are listening to our customers and associates and providing them more of what they need, helping them solve challenging issues, and providing them with innovation that enables their success. We have always had the broadest assortment in the industry, introduced to our customers through the industry’s best trained sales force. Over the last couple of years, we have taken that position of strength and improved the flexibility and agility of our supply chain. Additionally, we have improved our ability to be “right on price” through strong partnerships with our suppliers and a new pricing tool that enables us to target pricing at the item level for each individual customer. That is Sysco: innovating in food sales and supply chain. I am pleased with the progress we are making, and I am extremely excited for our future. Strong Financial Performance Achieved During Industry Pandemic Recovery I’m very proud of the strong financial performance Sysco delivered in FY22. We grew annual sales by 36.9%1 , on a comparable 52-week basis, to more than $68 billion. We delivered $2.6 billion of adjusted operating income.1 In the U.S., Sysco grew more than 1.3 times the industry. This result exceeded our goal for the year, and our second half of the year performance was even stronger than the first. This outperformance in the U.S., along with much improved performance in our international businesses, helped drive over $17 billion of total company sales growth for the year. During the fiscal year, we successfully executed our capital allocation strategy. We made significant investments in our business, reduced Sysco’s debt by $450 million, and returned $1.5 billion to shareholders, through both share repurchases and dividends. As a result, we ended the year at 2.9x net debt to Adjusted EBITDA1 . Substantial Progress Toward our Recipe for Growth Strategy We made substantial progress on our Recipe for Growth strategy, which aims to strengthen our capabilities in five pillars: Digital, Products and Solutions, Supply Chain, Customer Teams and Future Horizons. FY22 highlights include: z Implemented an intelligent, data-driven pricing system to improve our ability to be “right on price” at the customer and item level. z Enhanced Shop, our digital shopping platform, by personalizing our customers’ experience and improving search navigation, making it even easier to re-order essentials, and introducing product recommendation engines that increase customer basket size. LETTER FROM Kevin Hourican President and Chief Executive Officer OUR CEO Our CEO 1 Each of these measures are non-GAAP financial measures. See pages 28 through 38 in the accompanying Form 10-K and Annex A for a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP results and an explanation of the adjustments that we have made in order to calculate these adjusted measures. z Introduced new customer propositions called Sysco Your Way and Sysco Perks. Both programs are intended to improve the service experience to our most strategic customers. Both programs will be scaled in the coming year, nationally. z Transformed our U.S. supply chain to a full six-day service week, while also converting most of our associates to a four-day schedule. This change will enable Sysco to grow profitably for years to come by better leveraging our physical assets and setting the industry standard for increased service. z Launched new training programs for our frontline associates, including our Sysco Driver Academy and a CDL training program to help source new drivers from within Sysco and provide new career opportunities to our associates. z Advanced our specialty cuisine platforms through acquisition and integration of new companies. We are scaling our Italian platform through our Greco and Sons business, introducing top-selling items to most geographies and improving team selling across businesses. We also advanced our capabilities in the fast-growing and profitable produce category by adding two acquisitions to FreshPoint, our specialty produce company. Sysco is leading the industry from a position of strength, and we remain confident that our Recipe for Growth strategy will enable us to grow 1.5x faster than the total market by the end of fiscal year 2024. Leading our Industry Toward a Sustainable Future We are proud to have been the first company in our industry to commit to a science-based target to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. We announced our commitment to purchase nearly 800 electric trucks, and we piloted an electric refrigerated trailer, which we believe will ultimately result in our ability to make deliveries to our customers in fully electric vehicles, reducing both carbon and noise pollution. To help reach our Global Good Goal to donate $500 million worth of goods and services across our global communities by 2025, we launched a global volunteer recognition program in FY22. During the year, our associates volunteered more than 10,000 hours. Much of that time was spent in food banks, food shelters, and organizations focused on improving food insecurity. Additionally, Sysco donated millions of meals to support the communities we serve, and through our Nourishing Neighbors program we pledged to donate $1 million to Feeding America. We continue to prioritize our efforts to advance diversity, equity and inclusion at Sysco. Our Global DEI Council developed our DEI framework and key initial priorities and we also launched new efforts to increase our purchases from diverse suppliers, including developing a diverse supplier mentorship program. Importantly, for the first time, we are including advancing our DEI and carbon reduction efforts in our executive compensation program. I am confident that our leadership team is fully committed to making meaningful progress. Positioned to Deliver Long-Term, Profitable Growth We could not have accomplished these impressive results without the more than 71,000 associates at Sysco, whose passion and dedication fuel our success. Our associates are the lifeblood and backbone of our company, and they ensure Sysco remains the leader in our industry. Their relentless focus on our customers represents a daily demonstration of our purpose in action – connecting the world to share food and care for one another. They continue to be an inspiration to me every single day. While we are closely monitoring macroeconomic pressures across the globe, we’re upbeat about our business and prepared to navigate another dynamic year. We will continue to deliver market share gains and profitable growth in FY23. Our leadership team, board of directors, and all our associates are committed to delivering outstanding results to our shareholders as well as continuing to earn your trust and investment.

We spent more than $9 billion on research and development and capital expenditures in 2022 as we continue to invest in technology and innovation and fund future organic growth. We generated $7.2 billion in cash flow from operations and ended the year with $4.9 billion in free cash flow despite a $1.6 billion additional U.S. federal cash tax payment associated with the amortization of R&D spending for federal tax purposes. We continue to reduce costs, achieving over $400 million in merger-related gross cost synergies. These bring our total synergies to about $1.4 billion since the merger, and we are on track to meet our target of $1.5 billion a year earlier than planned. We also returned $5.9 billion to shareowners in 2022 through dividends and share repurchases, bringing our capital return merger-to-date to $13.3 billion. Continued progress Sustainable aviation Raytheon Technologies’ commitment to sustainable air travel continues to advance. In October, Airbus began development flight testing of the Pratt & Whitney GTF Advantage engine on an A320neo aircraft. The GTF Advantage is the world’s most efficient and sustainable single-aisle aircraft engine, and last year it also proved capable of running on 100 percent sustainable aviation fuel. Since entering service in 2016, GTF engines have saved more than one billion gallons of jet fuel and more than 10 million metric tons of CO2. Our leadership in sustainability was also evident in NASA’s selection of Pratt & Whitney to develop advanced engine technologies to reduce fuel consumption and emissions for the next single-aisle aircraft. Meanwhile, the European Union Commission selected Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney, via the Clean Aviation Joint Undertaking, to team with EU and UK partners on seven sustainable aviation development projects, ranging from hybrid electric propulsion and thermal management to novel wing designs and future liquid hydrogen storage tanks. Additionally, our 2021 acquisition of FlightAware continues to progress as we integrate aircraft tracking and AI-driven prediction tools into offerings for airports, commercial and business aviation and even uncrewed aircraft system customers. Smarter defense Raytheon Technologies continues to be an essential partner in U.S. and allied defense. We are a leader in the development of operational hypersonic and counter-hypersonic systems, a key strategy for the U.S. military. After a second successful flight test of the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept in July, the U.S. Air Force awarded Raytheon Missiles & Defense a $1 billion contract to develop the Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile. RMD also completed the systems requirement review for its glide phase interceptor prototype to defend the United States from hypersonic missile threats. As part of the U.S. government’s support for Ukraine, Raytheon Technologies’ solutions are being used to defend Ukrainian citizens, including the Javelin weapon system, Stinger missiles and GPS-guided Excalibur munitions. In November, the U.S. Army “Since entering service in 2016, GTF engines have saved more than one billion gallons of jet fuel and more than 10 million metric tons of CO2.” Adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures. See page 14 for additional information on non-GAAP measures. awarded the company a $1.2 billion contract for six National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems for Ukraine, and in December, the U.S. government announced plans to send a Global Patriot Solutions missile defense system to Ukraine. In September, Pratt & Whitney delivered its 1,000th F135 engine—the safest, most capable military jet engine in operation. We are also working on modernization of the F-35, pairing Pratt & Whitney’s F135 Engine Core Upgrade with Collins’ Emergency Power and Cooling System for significantly more thrust, range and thermal capabilities. These engine system upgrades will greatly enhance engine efficiency and engine life, as well as reduce life cycle cost. This unique solution demonstrates the true power of our company. Raytheon Technologies continues to support multi-domain operations on several fronts, including the next phase of development for the U.S. Army’s TITAN program, a tactical ground station that finds and tracks threats to support long-range precision targeting. Collins was awarded a production contract of up to $583 million for the Mounted Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing System Gen II Program. RMD was awarded a $651 million contract, with options totaling $2.5 billion, for the AN/SPY-6(V) family of radars to equip 31 U.S. Navy ships. RMD also delivered the first Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor to the U.S. Army, providing a stepped increase of performance from our legacy Patriot system, defending against a range of threats, from crewed and uncrewed aircraft to cruise missiles and ballistic missiles. Intelligent space technologies We continue to make advances in space technologies, which we know will be essential for the future of global commerce, scientific discovery and security. In 2022, Raytheon Intelligence & Space delivered the ground test and flight operations system in support of the James Webb Space Telescope, and Collins was selected to produce NASA’s nextgeneration spacesuit for the International Space Station. In November, NASA launched Artemis 1, which included key subsystems and avionics from Collins, and also included CubeSat miniature satellites that leverage precision avionics from our recently acquired Blue Canyon Technologies. 2 RAYTHEON TECHNOLOGIES 2022 ANNUAL REPORT RAYTHEON TECHNOLOGIES 2022 ANNUAL REPORT 3 How we are advancing 2022 was our first full year using our common operating system, known as CORE (customer-oriented results and excellence). Our CORE system provides a common language, toolset and methodology for delivering on customer commitments— all directed toward organic growth through greater collaboration. Our CORE operating system is showcased in our new state-of-the-art advanced casting foundry and airfoil production facility in Asheville, North Carolina, which opened its doors in November. The facility’s highly automated manufacturing will improve the quality and productivity of high-volume programs for decades to come. Our modernization efforts are also reflected in our linking of more than15,000 machine tools and test stands to our network and deploying an internet-of-things layer to 46 additional factories. Thanks to CORE initiatives in our factory in Largo, Florida, we achieved a 25 percent reduction in cycle time and a 10 percent reduction in floor space. Clearly, supply chain disruptions affected the global economy—and Raytheon Technologies. But we were able to reduce the impact through our dedicated team of specialists who worked with our 14,000 product suppliers to monitor performance, diagnose problems and find solutions. We make products essential to national security and flight safety, and the criticality of that fact underpins everything we do. We understand the importance of delivering what customers need today, while investing our time and talents innovating for the future. We will make advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning to help enhance shared knowledge and to aid critical decision-making in aerospace, defense and space. We will also continue to develop advanced digital models that increase our industry’s efficiency and productivity, while investing in smart cyber solutions to ensure system safety. Commitments to our communities and our workforce In 2022, we put our People, Planet and Principles environmental, social and governance strategy into practice. We built and integrated measurement systems across our company, adding the same engineering rigor and discipline we bring to our product development to our ESG strategy, to create long-term outcomes that will impact generations to come. As an example, we can see clearly where we continue to make progress on diversity, equity and inclusion. We track global workforce shifts to determine where to make the most impactful community and academic investments that can help solve the pipeline challenge. From there, we are working to achieve executive gender parity, aiming for 50 percent women executives across the globe. And we seek to double the representation of people of color in executive roles compared to 2020. Improving opportunities for all people is aligned with maintaining the health of our planet. As we look to the future as an industry, we face critical questions about how to grow sustainably. I believe Raytheon Technologies has the talent, technology and vision to meet the environmental challenges ahead and to lead our industry into the future. Whether it is sustainability or workforce equity, our ambitions are clearly outlined, and we have prioritized progress. Our Board of Directors reviews our plans and milestones regularly and assesses our performance in these areas under our annual incentive compensation plan. Resilience leads to progress and growth Since the merger in 2020, we’ve been tested—by the pandemic, by inflation and supply chain issues, and by labor shortages. And we have demonstrated our resilience: We’ve strived to maintain our commitments to our customers and communities, and we’ve built a backlog that supports our position as an industry leader. As I write this letter, we have just announced a reorganization of our business units to better position Raytheon Technologies for the future. We stand on 100 years of pioneering technology, and yet we still have the energy and opportunity of a newly formed company. One thing you can count on: We will continue to disrupt ourselves when needed in the ongoing pursuit of better ways to deliver value to our customers and all stakeholders. My thanks to our dedicated team for another outstanding year. And thanks to you, our shareowners, for your ongoing support of Raytheon Technologies as we continue to lead, inspire and redefine our industry. Thank you for your belief in our ability to deliver value to you, and thank you for your trus",

59,StoneX Group,Diversified Financials,"3,615",66036,2138,207,0.3,SNEX,"In 2022, amid extreme market volatility, StoneX achieved record operating revenues and earnings. Our outstanding results showcase not only StoneX’s strength and resilience, but also our continued growth toward becoming a premier global financial services Our record financial performance was broad-based across all products and client segments. More details
regarding segment performance and composition can be found on pages 26-27.
We have also seen significant strength in the dollar over the past several quarters. The majority of our earnings
and variable compensation are denominated in dollars. Despite this, we have a significant amount of locally
denominated fixed expenses. We believe the strong dollar reduced our 2022 expenses by approximately
$20 million when translating our non-dollar expenses to dollars for reporting purposes. We have entered into
certain hedging arrangements to continue to lock in this benefit.
Our strategy in action
We believe that our impressive 2022 financial results and our 20-year track record of consistent and significant
revenue growth are directly correlated with our relentless focus on becoming a best-in-class global financial
services ecosystem.
We have seen an increase in the cadence and delivery of our key projects, and many of these are now through
beta testing and have either been launched or are currently awaiting deployment. Our approach is always to
introduce and market our new capabilities at a steady, incremental basis. None of these projects in isolation
will result in a significant change to our current growth trajectory, and certain initiatives may not be viable in the
long run. In aggregate, however, we believe that these initiatives will ‘bend our growth curve’ upwards. As many
of these strategies are digital in nature, as they are deployed, we believe we will see operational leverage and
scalability start to kick in and experience a steady improvement in margins.
Technology and digitization are recurring themes throughout our strategic objectives set out below. While
the legacy StoneX has traditionally focused on a high-touch approach catering to large commercial and
institutional clients, we have also ramped up our investment in technology significantly over the last 5 years.
This has allowed us to become innovators by offering our high-touch clients better ways to engage with our
ecosystem, which will in turn make them stickier and more valuable. As we accelerate towards a more digital
approach, we are engaging a much broader and deeper client base with a significantly larger TAM.
In addition, technology allows us to target new client segments where our traditional high-touch approach may
not be appropriate or cost-effective. As an example, the acquisition of GAIN brought us a self-directed mobile
platform focused on high-net-worth retail and small professional trading clients. This will also result in a more
scalable infrastructure and increased operational leverage, which should drive margins. In short, as we digitize,
we are transforming ourselves into more of a fintech business.
2022 was another successful year where we made tremendous headway with each of our four strategic
company objectives.
Build our ecosystem – We must remain relevant to our clients and prospects by adding more of the products
and services they want and by providing them with the best ecosystem possible for accessing the global
financial markets. Doing so enables us to increase engagement and wallet share from existing clients while
attracting new clients who cannot satisfy their needs elsewhere, or who are dissatisfied with how those needs
are being met.
In our securities segment, we continued to expand both our product offering as well as our geographic reach.
Our securities-based revenues have grown by 33% over the last three years. On the equities side, we launched
our electronic market-making capabilities to internalize and capture spread on domestic US equities while

providing best execution. We are leveraging our long-standing institutional relationships of over 20 years on the
international equities side. This is a new market opportunity for us which we will ramp up incrementally over the
next year or so, and one which has the potential to be a material source of revenue for the business.
On the fixed income side, we have steadily been diversifying into different asset classes to round out our
offering. We have started to leverage our capabilities internationally into Europe and Asia with the addition of
key professional hires to our team. We also expanded our capabilities in both regions to support trading and
clearing in a broad range of securities products. We believe that we can leverage our broad-based product
capabilities and trading flows to provide liquidity and execution to clients on an increasingly global basis.
We are planning to launch our cash equities capability to our international self-directed retail platform in the first
quarter of 2023, allowing clients to seamlessly trade investment products as well as leveraged OTC products.
In the US, we will be launching StoneX One, which will offer a
multi-asset class mobile trading platform to retail investors.
StoneX One will provide our retail clients with a truly
unique cross-asset platform with self-directed execution
capabilities. Initially, this will include cash equities, options,
and futures, and will be followed shortly by foreign
exchange, cryptocurrency, fixed income and precious
metals. All the trading flow will be directed to our electronic
market-making platform, which will give us the opportunity,
where appropriate, to internalize spreads. In the future, we can leverage our wealth management capabilities
by offering robo-advisory, portfolio management, and even estate planning options for our retail clients.
In Brazil, we have started work on our new Digital Pay In (“DPI”) offering, which allows international companies
to collect foreign currency payments from local clients in a digitally efficient way. This has significant potential
in Brazil and other jurisdictions and opens up a new and unique payments capability for our existing large
corporate clients.
As we have done consistently for the last 20 years, we continue to ensure that we offer broad access to
products, markets, and exchanges that our clients want to access – in essence, we open markets. We
continue to innovate and offer new and enhanced OTC hedging products to our clients, and have invested in
our technology stack to accomplish this faster and more effectively. We are now introducing dozens of new
products every month, some of which are new and industry leading, such as cattle swaps, which we introduced
into Australia in October. We have also added several new exchanges and liquidity venues. In addition to
gaining incremental revenue, these new product offerings position StoneX as a leading innovator focused on
adding value to our clients.
Grow/diversify client base – We are a client-centric business and strive to grow our client footprint
consistently by entering new markets, expanding market share in our existing markets, and adding new client
segments and channels. Our broad range of capabilities enables us to serve clients of nearly every type,
which creates a large addressable market for us and a significant opportunity for top-line growth – given that
our current market penetration is likely in the single basis point range. Seizing this opportunity will enable us to
increase volume and lower earnings volatilityenterprise. Operating revenues rose to a record $2.1 billion (up 26%), while net income exceeded $207 million, up 78%. Shareholder equity eclipsed the billion-dollar benchmark for the first time, rising to $1.07 billion. For the past two decades, our mission at StoneX has been to consistently look for new geographic markets
and increase our product and service offering, in turn driving our top-line growth.
Our securities expansion has seen some early success as we seek to increase our client penetration outside
the US. We are offering our products and capabilities to institutional investors in Europe and Asia, where
we currently have limited market share and thus a large opportunity for client expansion. We are currently
bolstering our capabilities in London to enable a more well-rounded offering.
Our multi-asset class digital trading platforms will substantially expand our retail addressable market and allow
us to capture additional wallet share from existing clients. We also plan to leverage these self-directed trading
platforms to reach and service smaller agricultural producers specializing in row crops, livestock, and dairy
directly via the Farm Advantage mobile platform. This is a compelling opportunity for us to tap into a new and
potentially large client segment.
We have launched our digital payments offering in Brazil for small and medium-sized corporations seeking
international payments, which will soon be expanded to the US and Europe. As we roll out this new platform,
we will add the ability to hedge currencies as well as other products. This is significant, as it will enable us to
leverage our proven product capabilities for hedging clients into an entirely new client segment. Additionally,
we will also be offering this payment capability to all our existing corporate clients, further cementing our
relationships with them.Earnings per share (diluted) were $10.01, and we achieved an ROE of 21% despite our equity having increased by 39% over the last two years. Over the past 20 years, we have compounded operating revenue at 32% per annum and Digitize our business – We firmly believe that the digitization of client platforms – backed by highly agile and
efficient infrastructure – is a key requisite for our continued growth. We believe this digitization will enable us
to increase global market share in our massive TAM more efficiently while simultaneously providing scalability
and margin expansion. Our keys to this approach are threefold: 1) aggregation and ease of access to data
across the enterprise for strategic use, 2) open, flexible and modular architecture to enable scalability, and 3)
opportunities for trade internalization across platforms that benefit our clients via better pricing and improve
our bottom line via higher margins.
We have made significant investments to develop a more efficient and scalable technology stack that enables
a faster cadence in delivering digital solutions for our clients. These capabilities and platforms will be powered
by our digital marketing team to drive adoption and increase incremental revenue.
We have several projects underway which will make our internal processes more efficient and scalable,
allowing us to realize some operational leverage and margin expansion as we continue to grow. Most of these
initiatives are underpinned by our “data lake” project. This allows us to access all data centrally and in real time
from our many systems of record, where the information is stored and normalized. This dramatically reduces
the end-to-end connections required by our functional areas to get a full view of client activity and generates
one place to obtain all relevant information.
We continue to see this data being leveraged by several business segments to quickly deploy technology
solutions and better manage our operations. Our risk management process has been enhanced and we now
have real-time monitoring capabilities across the business, providing superior insight and ability to manage
volatile market conditions. Our global platforms are also accessing this information, allowing us to more
effectively launch client-facing applications. During 2022, we substantially completed a multi-year conversion
to a new system for accounting and human resources and are now enjoying some meaningful synergies and
scalability as we continue to grow. We have similar projects underway on the compliance and treasury side
of our business, which we are looking forward to implementing in the near future. We have also introduced a
contract management system for our legal team, a technology to better track and monitor internal audit and
operational risk issues, and incremental technology improvements for compliance and KYC monitoring.
During the year we launched StoneHedge for our grain merchandising clients. This platform is deployed
throughout the client’s enterprise, allowing them to price and auto-hedge grain purchases in real time from the
convenience of a mobile device. This platform is integrated into the client’s enterprise system, allowing all data
to be instantly accessed, driving efficiencies for the client. Our technology division recently became a member
of the SWIFT Partnership Program. Membership provides StoneX clients with a direct connection to the SWIFT
API platform, which provides a new level of end-to-end transparency. StoneX Global Payments will be the first
business segment to deploy this new functionality, with clients having full visibility into the status of their crossborder payments throughout the entire transaction lifecycle.
We continue to deploy advanced technology across our trading businesses to efficiently price markets in a
rapidly expanding product set, as well as internalize trade flow to enhance spread capture and better monetize
client trading flow.
All these initiatives and projects serve to make us a more efficient, effective and scalable business.
2022 ANNUAL REPORT I 24
Compound capital – From our earliest days, we have focused on expanding our capital base by maintaining
consistent profitability and reinvesting those profits back into the business so that we can create our own
capital runway for growth. We strive to deploy this capital wisely through a disciplined M&A approach focused
on deals that will accrete immediately to earnings, and by making allocation decisions focused on ROE. We
believe this approach has been key to our ability to achieve stable and consistent growth, and we will continue
to pursue it going forward.
In fiscal 2022, we achieved an adjusted ROE of 21%, significantly above our 15% target. Additionally, over the
past ten years, we have tripled our shareholder funds and completed over 20 acquisitions to strengthen our
business and expand our global client footprint. This has all been achieved with a negligible increase in our
issued share count, as these acquisitions were largely financed organically from retained earnings and the
unbelievable power of compounding.
StoneX is committed to identifying strategic opportunities and investments that deliver growth for our business
and value to our clients and investors. In November, we announced the acquisition of Cotton Distributors Inc.
This purchase not only enhances the value of our commodities trading business with physical cotton trading
capabilities, but also expands our footprint in Brazil and Continental Europe.
Our patient and disciplined approach to acquisitions has reaped significant benefits for our shareholders, as
evidenced by our share price reaching all-time highs this year. In April, we closed the renewal of our parent-level
credit facility through 2025, while also expanding the capacity under the facility to $475 million. This expansion
was possible with additional support from existing lenders, as well as several new banks joining our syndicate.
With the support of this expanded group of bank partners, we look forward to continuing to increase our
product offerings to our growing client base in the years to come.
ESG progress
We believe that a strong commitment to ESG practices is critical for our long-term success as a business,
as it influences our approach to risk management, environmental impact, community outreach, corporate
governance, and ultimately the way we serve our clients.
StoneX recently became a member of the Nodal Exchange, which offers renewable fuels and pollutants
contracts to support an increasing focus on corporate sustainability and carbon neutrality. Our institutional
clients can now access these environmental options and futures contracts, which span markets that include
sustainable energy, carbon emissions, renewable fuels, and pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen
oxide. We are committed to helping our clients access the widest range of commodity-focused contracts to
meet their environmentally focused goals.
We are pleased to note that we have worked to diversify our board to set the “tone at the top”. Our business
satisfies the NASDAQ diversity standard, and we will continue to work hard to ensure StoneX is an inclusive and
diverse organization. We do not see this merely as an ESG requirement but more as an essential ingredient to a
high-performing organization.
We provide updates to some of the internal policies and initiatives we reported last year on page 28.
In addition to providing updates to internal policies and initiatives, we also detail some of the ways we are
helping our clients achieve their ESG objectives, as well as the roles we are playing to facilitate the orderly and  shareholder capital at 28% per annum. Over this same period, our market value has increased from $1.5 million to $1.68 billion and our share price has effective function of those new markets that have arisen to serve their needs. These include providing clients
with education and access to carbon credit markets globally; adding access to a full suite of environmental
contracts to address the ESG needs of clients; and our payments platform’s ongoing track record of helping
hundreds of charities and NGOs ensure millions of dollars make it from their donors to people on the ground
carrying out their missions.
Looking forward
As we look ahead to 2023, we will continue to relentlessly pursue our goal of becoming a leading financial
services platform and an integral part of the global financial infrastructure. We anticipate heightened market
volatility and rising interest rates to continue to create a
tailwind for our business. However, we also recognize that the
anticipated global market downturn may pose a challenge
in the future. We will therefore continue to evolve and adjust
our strategies based on developing economic conditions to
ensure our robust growth continues.
We have validated our acquisition of GAIN through our results
so far, and have significantly expanded our footprint, client reach and product offering.
We have made large investments in technology over the last five years to put in place the foundations required
to accelerate the digitization of our business. As we continue to implement institutional-grade platforms for
our clients, we should further accelerate our growth with the scalability that technology provides to increase
margins and profitability.
As clients increasingly seek global solutions, awareness of the StoneX brand and ecosystem grows across the
global financial marketplace. We are incredibly optimistic about our future and our ability to drive value to both
our clients and shareholders.
Above all, we remain dedicated to our client-centric culture. Our commitment to serving our growing global
client footprint and providing best-in-class service is embedded into the StoneX DNA.
On behalf of the entire executive management team, I want to first and foremost thank all our clients - we are
grateful for your commitment and trust in our ability to drive value to your business. I want to also thank all of
my StoneX colleagues for their continued dedication to making this year another incredible success, along
with our board and advisors for their guidance, our bankers for their financial support, and our shareholders for
entrusting their capital to us. increased from $0.64 to $82.94 – a gain of approximately 130 times.1 Our robust 2022 financial results are a direct validation of the value of our client offering and our ongoing commitment to providing global market access, institutional-grade platforms and technology, deep expertise and high-touch service. We are continuously investing in our products and services and expanding our capabilities in areas where we can increase our market share. We have an enormous total addressable market (“TAM”) in front of us, which presents a significant opportunity for us to further develop our suite of services, which we believe will further scale our business in 2023 and beyond. Overview Fiscal 2022 was a year of exceptional growth and progress toward our long-term strategic objectives, which include digitizing our offerings, expanding our client base and building our global financial ecosystem. We were pleased to see broad-based double-digit revenue growth across all of our products and client segments, with our business benefiting significantly from the effects of inflationary pressures on the global markets, sharp increases in short-term interest rates, and continued volatility in both financial and physical markets. As an example, three of our five busiest days in the history of our business in terms of transactional volume occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, principally due to the Ukraine conflict - with the other two days occurring during the initial onset of the Covid pandemic in fiscal 2020. Almost two years ago, in the middle of the Covid pandemic, we concluded the acquisition of GAIN, which was our largest acquisition to date. At the outset, the rationale for this strategic acquisition was that GAIN’s retail clients would bring additional flow into products we already trade, allowing us to combine this new flow with our existing trade flow. We would also be able to provide clearing services and additional products that were previously inaccessible to GAIN’s retail clients, especially in U.S. markets. Furthermore, we saw the opportunity for some easy cost synergies – most of which have been realized - as well as acquiring talented employees, especially on the digital marketing side of our business. CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S LETTER 1 Share price and market cap data for NASDAQ: SNEX ranges from 9/30/02 to 9/30/22. 2022 ANNUAL REPORT I 19 Over the last two years, our transaction rationale has been validated as GAIN has exceeded the expectations we laid out. We effectively executed on all integration objectives and now see retail trading flow as a key part of our franchise. In aggregate, our average client float for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 was $8.6 billion, up 50% from a year ago. This sharp increase was due to growing engagement from existing clients, strong organic growth in our client footprint and higher margin rates caused by rising volatility. In the wake of 2022’s rate hikes, we have experienced an acceleration in interest earnings on client balances, up 243% for the full fiscal year versus 2021, with the majority of this growth being recorded in the fourth quarter. These significant increases in both product volumes and client float speak to the broadening and deepening of our client base and the validation of our strategy, as well as to the continued effort and dedication of our team in expanding the StoneX ecosystem",

We also boldly advanced our internal business and digital transformation. And 
From a capital allocation perspective, we returned $10.9 billion to shareholders through dividends of $3.0 billion
and share repurchases of $7.9 billion. We increased our dividend by 7% – the 21st consecutive year of increases.
We continued our multi-year share repurchase program, including a $4 billion accelerated share repurchase that
was announced and substantially completed in the fourth quarter.
These business results, combined with our capital deployment, allowed us to deliver significant value to our
shareholders, reflected in our total shareholder return of 40% for 2022.we utilized our dynamic capital allocation process that integrates our business results and expectations, along with market and financial conditions, to maximize returns for our stockholders. Our OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS ACROSS THE BUSINESS DEMONSTRATE
THE STRENGTH OF OUR INDUSTRY-LEADING PORTFOLIO OF INTEGRATED
PLATFORMS AND SYSTEMS
Each of Lockheed Martin’s four business areas
achieved key successes in 2022.
Aeronautics Advanced the Future of Flight on a
Global Scale
The U.S. Department of Defense and Lockheed Martin
finalized a $30 billion contract for the production
and delivery of up to 398 F-35s – including U.S.,
international partners and Foreign Military Sales
aircraft in Lots 15 and 16, with the option for Lot 17.
This deal continues our commitment to delivering
unparalleled fifth-generation capabilities for our
airmen, sailors, and marines, while providing the best
value to the taxpayer.
F-35 international interest grew as key allies continued
to look to the world’s most advanced 5th generation
fighter as their airpower solution. In September,
the Swiss parliament gave final approval and
signed a Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) to buy
36 F-35As, valued at about $6.25 billion. Also last
year, Finland and Germany signed LOAs for 64 and
35 F-35As, respectively. Greece sent an official request
to the United States to purchase 20 F-35s, as did the
Czech government for 24 F-35s. Canada entered the
finalization phase of the procurement process with the
U.S. government and Lockheed Martin to purchase
88 F-35s for the Royal Canadian Air Force.
Our Aeronautics business – together with industry
partners and customers at the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency and the Air Force Research
Lab – conducted a test of the Hypersonic Air-breathing
Weapon Concept. The historic flight reached speeds
in excess of Mach 5 and altitudes greater than 65,000
feet, demonstrating air-breathing hypersonic systems
are a cost-effective solution to address rapidly
emerging threats in the global security arena.
Aeronautics’ F-16 program continued its robust
international growth. In June, Jordan signed an LOA
for eight new F-16 Block 70 aircraft to be built at our
facility in Greenville, South Carolina. In November,
Bulgaria signed an LOA for eight additional F-16 jets
for its fleet. The first new F-16 Block 70 completed
Final Assembly & Checkout and paint phases in
Greenville and in January 2023 successfully conducted
its maiden flight.
Aeronautics also continued to see growth in air
mobility in 2022. We delivered our 500th C-130J in
March, along with three C-130J-30s for Germany,
which is a first-time Hercules operator. We also saw
the first of five C-130J-30s for Indonesia take flight.
In October, Australia’s Department of Defence
announced it would seek to replace and expand its
current medium air-mobility fleet of 12 C-130J-30s
with a total of 24 new C-130J-30s.
Skunk Works® continues to be a growth engine with
expansion in classified and international work.
Missiles and Fire Control Tested and Provided Vital
Combat Capabilities
Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control (MFC)
was in the global spotlight in 2022 for providing vital
combat capabilities in Ukraine.
We were honored to host several high-level VIP
customer visits, showcasing our products and our
world-class workforce. In May, our Pike County
Operations Facility in Troy, Alabama, welcomed
President Joe Biden for an official White House visit.
The president toured the Javelin production line and
met Lockheed Martin employees. The United States
has committed more than 5,500 Javelins to Ukraine.
In August, our operations facility in Camden, Arkansas,
hosted Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition
and Sustainment Dr. Bill LaPlante and the Assistant
Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and
Technology Doug Bush. During the visit, they toured
the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, M270, and2022 initiatives were built upon the 21st Century Security (21CS) vision that was first introduced in 2020. We worked with our customers to meet their urgent needs while working with them to transform the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System production
lines and met with a group of employees to thank
them for their support of national security. Lockheed
Martin is committed to providing these vital combat
capabilities to the U.S. military and our allies.
MFC successfully demonstrated a new, layered missile
defense integration for the U.S. Army. The Terminal
High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) Weapon System
launched a PAC-3™ Missile Segment Enhancement
(MSE) to intercept a tactical ballistic missile target
without the support of a Patriot fire unit. Integration
into the THAAD Weapon System allowed the PAC3 MSE to be launched earlier and yields greater
flexibility for the soldier in the field. This integration
provides the Army more options with existing
equipment to choose the best interceptor for 21stcentury threats, resulting in a more tightly integrated
missile defense system.
In addition, Lockheed Martin continued to meet a key
growth priority for customers by successfully testing
hypersonic technologies. MFC and the U.S. Air Force
successfully conducted an end-to-end flight test of
the Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW),
demonstrating the weapon’s ability to reach and
withstand operational hypersonic speeds, collect
crucial data for use in further flight tests, and validate
safe separation from the aircraft to designated targets
from significant distances. We leveraged resources,
talent, and lessons learned from across all four
business areas to accelerate the development of
hypersonic strike capabilities like ARRW, which our
customers need to deter the threat of hypersonic
attacks by potential adversaries.
Our next-generation Tactical Infrared Search and
Track (TacIRST™) sensors succeeded in two flight
tests, including guiding an autonomous uncrewed
aircraft and sharing threat-detection data among five
aircraft including a Lockheed Martin Sabreliner acting
as a surrogate fighter, an uncrewed MQ-20 Avenger,
and three F-5 fighters. By leveraging open-mission
systems, our team demonstrated that common
platform integration is possible across a variety of
vehicles – bringing advanced 21st-century capabilities
to our customers quicker and more affordably.
Rotary and Mission Systems Enabled Networked
Threat Detection and Achieved Key Rotary-Wing
Aircraft Milestones
The Missile Defense Agency selected Lockheed
Martin to provide core components of the Defense
of Guam layered system architecture. Rotary and
Mission Systems (RMS) will provide and integrate
the Aegis combat system, a new TPY-X radar
derived from Long Range Discrimination Radar,
launching systems, and connection to the command,
control, battle management, and communications
(C2BMC) system. Through an open mission-systems
architecture, we will integrate best-of-breed systems
from multiple original equipment manufacturers,
including our Sentinel A4, THAAD, and PAC-3 MSE.
This program represents a strategic pathfinder to
secure future integrated air and missile defense and
JADO opportunities, establishing new standards for
operations and joint force interoperability.
In 2022, initial operational capability (IOC) was
announced for three significant rotary-wing aircraft
of RMS’ Sikorsky line of business – the CH-53K®,
the Combat Rescue Helicopter, and the VH-92A
presidential helicopter.
In April, the U.S. Marine Corps declared IOC for the
CH-53K heavy-lift helicopter. This vote of confidence
from Marine Corps leadership underscores the vital
role of the CH-53K around the globe – giving forces
more range and agility to conduct expeditionary
heavy-lift assault transport of armored vehicles,
equipment, and personnel. The path to IOC involved
collaboration between Sikorsky, the U.S. Navy,
and Marine Corps to develop, test, and validate the
advanced capabilities of this 21st-century aircraft.
The U.S. Navy also declared full-rate production
of the CH-53K in December, a decision which is
expected to increase production to more than
20 helicopters annually in the coming years. This
decision stabilizes Sikorsky’s domestic supply chain,
allowing suppliers to purchase in bulk and creating
efficiencies to drive down overall costs for the U.S.
military and international allies.
In October, the U.S. Air Force declared IOC for the
HH-60W Jolly Green II CRH, validating the platform’s
operational readiness to deploy U.S. Air Force
rescue crews and strengthening the partnership and
teamwork between Sikorsky and the Air Force.
Sikorsky was awarded contracts by the U.S. Naval
Air Systems Command to produce and install an
additional VH-92A presidential helicopter Flight
Training Device and upgrade a previously delivered
Flight Training Device for the U.S. Marine Corps.
Sikorsky is also supporting the integration of VH-92
simulators and training equipment in relation to the
presidential helicopter program. defense enterprise. We know they face unparalleled threats and require multi-domain, highly interconnected, and interoperable solutions to ensure they stay ahead of ready. To this end, we made several strategic agreements with  America’s leading commercial digital technology companies to accelerate the development of advanced physical- and digital-world technologies. We completed successful hypersonic flight tests and engaged in one of the world’s largest military exercises, Space Led a New Era of Lunar Exploration and Global
Threat Deterrence
On November 16, the Lockheed Martin-built Orion
exploration-class spacecraft launched on the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s
(NASA’s) Artemis 1 and completed a 25.5-day
mission, splashing down off the coast of California.
This flight was the first in a series of increasingly
complex missions that will enable human exploration
to the moon and beyond.
Space announced a collaboration with Amazon
and Cisco to bring voice technology and video
collaboration to the moon. Lockheed Martin
integrated the Callisto technology demonstration
into NASA’s Artemis I uncrewed mission, providing
an opportunity to learn how astronauts could benefit
from far-field voice technology, artificial intelligence,
and tablet-based video collaboration.
The Space team secured a prototype agreement to
design and build 42 small satellites for the Space
Development Agency, which will enable JADOconnected operations and promote greater situational
awareness for our armed forces. Leveraging a factory
digital twin, the team is streamlining production and
also incorporating new technologies. These satellites
are part of Tranche 1, the initial warfighting capability
of the agency’s Transport Layer, creating a highly
capable, networked communications environment.
The sixth and final satellite in the Space BasedInfrared System (SBIRS) program series,
Geosynchronous Earth Orbit-6 (GEO-6), joined the
U.S. Space Force's constellation of missile warning
satellites equipped with robust infrared surveillance
sensors. The SBIRS program paves the way for the
Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared GEO
System, which will provide additional capabilities
such as cyber hardening, resiliency features,
enhanced spacecraft power, and improved propulsion
and electronics.
Along with the official groundbreaking of the
Next Generation Interceptor (NGI) Missile System
Integration Lab in Huntsville, Alabama, the NGI
team continued to drive program progress with the
successful validation of prototype communications
radio technology. Rigorous testing demonstrated
this vital component of the Missile Defense Agency’s
Ground-Based Midcourse Defense System can
receive and share data from the ground and
throughout the mission at tremendous speed, long
distances, and through harsh environments.
In September, the government of Australia awarded
Lockheed Martin a contract to establish the Southern
Positioning Augmentation Network. The program
will deliver a signal-augmenting global positioning
system and Galileo global navigation satellite
systems, improving positioning accuracy and integrity
in the Australasia region.
POSITIONING LOCKHEED MARTIN
FOR THE FUTURE
Progress on Implementing Our Vision for
21st Century Security
This year, we made tremendous strides in pursuit
of our vision to insert digital technologies like 5G,
artificial intelligence (AI), and distributed cloud
computing into existing defense systems to increase
mission capability and enhance global deterrence.
We deepened trust with our military customers in
theaters around the world through collaborative
experimentation in exercises such as Valiant Shield
and Project Convergence. We also demonstrated how
Lockheed Martin is uniquely suited to fill mission gaps
with our industry-leading portfolio of interoperable
solutions.
We announced a number of new strategic
relationships with some of the world’s leading
commercial technology companies, including Intel,
Microsoft, and IBM’s Red Hat. We also extended
our partnership with NVIDIA to include an AI-driven
environmental monitoring technology, and we
successfully demonstrated 5G.MIL® technologies
in collaboration with both AT&T and Verizon. We
expanded our relationship with Microsoft to become
the first non-government entity to operate inside the
Azure Government Secret Cloud. This new capability
will create faster, safer, and more affordable 21CS
solutions that will infuse immersive experiences and
other advanced commercial technologies into the most
capable defense systems.
To drive our evolution from a platform-centric
business model, we’ve engaged our customers in
the development of mission-focused technology
roadmaps. Our technology roadmaps are designed
to chart a logical path and provide an accelerated
timeline for iteratively connecting independent
platforms into an open-architecture network to create
a network effect – a holistic capability our customers
did not have before.partnering with U.S. forces in the Indo-Pacific to provide a glimpse of the future of Joint All-Domain Operations (JADO). Our groundbreaking technologies took American astronauts one step closer to setting foot on the moon. In addition, we Transforming Boldly as One Lockheed Martin
While we work to advance our strategic vision for
the future of the defense enterprise, we’re also
implementing a sweeping internal business and digital
transformation effort – 1LMX – which brings together
the integration of business process transformation,
digital transformation, data, automation, and
systems modernization to bring extraordinary speed,
agility, insights, and value to our customers and our
company. It is the culmination of a business and digital
transformation journey begun in 2017 – an essential
component to the future leadership and long-term
success of Lockheed Martin.
With the foundational capital funding provided by the
Lockheed Martin Board of Directors in early 2022,
1LMX will become the largest internal program ever
undertaken by the company. By reengineering our
business processes from end to end and unlocking new
approaches with digital enablement, 1LMX is creating
a model-based enterprise that is transforming how we
design, buy, build, and sustain the solutions we provide
our customers.
Throughout 2022, we’ve achieved successful
transformation across all our business areas. We’ve
identified “First Mover” programs with priority captures
where our 1LMX efforts will accelerate the new
transformation capabilities our customers demand.
1LMX is also helping us grow our company by placing
a focus on proposal management and by accelerating
capabilities needed for near-term new program wins.
The Path Ahead
Looking to 2023 and beyond, we continue to anticipate
growth over the long-term. Demand for Lockheed
Martin platforms and systems is strong in the United
States and abroad with significant sales opportunities
ahead. However, it will take time for these opportunities
to transition into contractual agreements and to
be reflected in our financial metrics. With residual
pandemic impacts and supply chain challenges
continuing, we now expect sustained growth to return in
2024.
By keeping our existing programs sold, winning new
business, and taking advantage of emerging opportunities,
we will continue to successfully navigate a challenging
business environment as well as strengthen our future
growth and leadership.
The Values Driving Us Forward
Our progress this year is a testament to the dedication
of our 116,000 team members and the values we share
– to do what’s right, respect others, and perform with
excellence.
In 2022, we contributed nearly $34 million to nonprofit
organizations and academic institutions that make
positive social impacts – such as supporting the
economic and mental well-being of veterans and
their families, making communities more resilient to
environmental disasters, and expanding opportunities in
science, technology, engineering and math to students
and workers of every background.
We worked together to foster innovation and integrity
while strengthening our communities and propelling
responsible business growth. And we positioned
Lockheed Martin to continue advancing scientific
discovery to enhance deterrence by driving both
physical- and digital-world technologies in service of our
national defense, and thereby delivering solutions to help
our customers keep people safe in our homeland and
around the world. continued to advance our One Lockheed Martin transformation (1LMX) initiative, which is modernizing and streamlining our operations to enhance our company’s speed and competitiveness. By connecting our industry-leading portfolio of products, systems, and services across business and functional boundaries, we augmented the ability of our four business areas to deliver solid strategic, operational, and financial results despite COVID-19’s ongoing impacts on our operations and our supply chain.

BALANCED BUSINESS MODEL
TO DRIVE LONG-TERM GROWTH
The strategic decisions we made over the past decade
have transformed Morgan Stanley’s business model.
We now derive half of our pre-tax profit from Wealth
and Investment Management, and we expect they
will become an increasingly larger driver of the Firm’s
pre-tax profit in the future. This provides stability
that will be further enhanced as we continue to grow
our client assets, while our preeminent Institutional
Securities franchise will continue to be a driver of
incremental revenue, particularly in active markets.
We have built unique competitive advantages
around each of our businesses and have significant
opportunities to maximize growth in the years ahead.
Our Wealth and Investment Management businesses
together held $5.5 trillion in client assets at the end of
2022. We have significant scale advantages in these
businesses and our longer-term goal is to grow these
assets to $10 trillion. The earnings power underlining
these businesses will serve as an economic engine
for the Firm for a long time.
We are confident in the long-term value proposition
of the Firm and remain committed to the goals we
outlined a year ago, including an ROTCE goal of 20%+
through business cycles. We also added a new goal
this year in Wealth Management for net new assets
that I outlined earlier. With a constructive outlook and
the proven track record we have delivered thus far,
we fully expect to achieve our goals over time.
INVESTING IN OUR PEOPLE AND TALENT
Our future growth and long-term success will also
be driven by the depth of talent across our Firm and
a strong culture that guides our employees. Investing
in broadening the diversity of our employeesleadership we have across our organization, broaden the diversity of this talent, and strengthen our culture of accountability, collaboration and inclusion. The senior management team is strong and experienced, and our and continuing to reinforce our culture remain
important objectives for our Board of Directors and
management teams across the world.
We have strong executive leadership and management
across our business and infrastructure organizations.
In addition, we are growing the generation of talent
needed in the next 10 and 20 years and are deeply
committed to investing in them and their success.
Over the past year, we continued to add responsibilities
to members of the executive leadership team to
broaden their management experience, giving
them more opportunities to develop and showcase
their capabilities.
More recently, a handful of seasoned executives on
our Operating Committee have stepped aside, either
to pursue new roles in the organization or to pursue
other opportunities. Shelley O’Connor, the Firm’s Head
of External Affairs, announced last summer that she
would retire from the Firm. Franck Petitgas announced
that he would step down from his role as Head of
Morgan Stanley International to become a Senior
Advisor. Jon Pruzan, our Chief Operating Officer and
former Chief Financial Officer, announced his
retirement from the Firm to pursue opportunities
outside the organization. Each of these individuals is
a long-serving, senior leader who represents the best
of our Firm and our culture. But after years of relative
stability amongst our broader management team,
such change is positive as it provides opportunities
for other talented leaders to broaden their
management capabilities.
For example, with Shelley O’Connor’s retirement, our
Chief Legal Officer, Eric Grossman, was also made
Chief Administrative Officer, taking over responsibility
for External Affairs. Following the retirement of
Jon Pruzan, Michael Pizzi assumed additional

for your investment in Morgan Stanleyother hand, delivered strong revenues. Our investments in Fixed Income over the past few years have yielded strong results. Fixed Income delivered its best annual result in over a decade as clients increased engagement in response to central banks’ rate-hiking cycle. Institutional Securities is a top three global leader in the industry as demonstrated by wallet share. We remain a leader in Equity and Investment Banking and have steadily rebuilt our Fixed Income franchise to focus on our strongest capabilities. Scale in our global businesses has been the foundation for gaining market share, and our competitive position is strong. We have demonstrated our ability to defend share and gain it in relatively more capital-light businesses. We also remain disciplined in our risk management and are appropriately careful with our resources, managing our risk-weighted assets and keeping our G-SIB surcharge consistent over three years. Wealth Management demonstrated strong growth in 2022, delivering record revenues of $24.4 billion and a pretax margin of 27.0%. While our total client assets declined to $4.2 trillion at the end of the year, we brought in $311 billion of net new assets in a very volatile market environment, with most major indices down about 20% or more. Our business continues to benefit from strong client demand across the platform, and asset generation across all our channels is supporting this growth. Net interest income benefited from higher Federal Funds rates and the investments in expanded bank offerings for our clients. With the top advisor-led business in the industry, complemented by leading workplace and selfdirected offerings, the wealth franchise we have built is in a category of one, reflecting the combination of best-in-class advice and best-in-class technology. We have leadership positions in each of these channels. The development of the self-directed and workplace FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND BUSINESS REVIEW 2022 was marked by an extraordinary set of events not seen in decades, putting our business model to the test. We started the year with the tail end of the global pandemic and significant geopolitical turmoil. U.S. inflation reached a 40-year high, and other global economies also experienced a rapid increase in prices. The Federal Reserve responded with the fastest rate increases in decades. The combined impact of persistent inflation and rapid central bank tightening pressured asset levels and hit investor sentiment, leading to very little new strategic activity and capital raising. Amidst this difficult backdrop, Morgan Stanley delivered strong results and produced a return on average tangible common equity (ROTCE) of 15.3% for the full year. The Firm reported annual net revenues of $53.7 billion and net income of $11.0 billion — the second highest in our history. The integrated investment bank — our Institutional Securities businesses — delivered revenues of $24.4 billion last year. Our Investment Banking revenues James P. Gorman Chairman and CEO 2023 SHAREHOLDER LETTER 3 channels was a concerted strategic shift, enabling us to meet any client wherever they are in their wealth accumulation journey and become their wealth management firm of choice. We have 18 million relationships across these channels, with the potential to deepen those relationships further and consolidate client assets onto our platform. Over the last three years, we grew net new assets by nearly $1 trillion. Our sources of net new assets are well diversified and include new and existing clients, self-directed assets, stock plan vesting and net recruiting, with no single source exceeding a 25% contribution. Given the scale and reach of our business, we expect to deliver $1 trillion in net new assets every three years going forward, assuming normal market appreciation consistent with historical performance. Our workplace channel is an important driver of consolidating assets onto our platform, and it continues to bring new relationships to the Firm. We have executed our strategy to deepen these relationships and have reached our goals to provide companion accounts to 90% of U.S. participants, and to achieve 30% retention of stock plan vested assets. From 2020 through the end of 2022, we have already seen flows of approximately $150 billion migrate to the advice-based channel that originated from a workplace relationship. A portion of these assets are the stock plan vested balances, but a larger portion is from assets held away. As we deliver our full suite of capabilities, our strategy to attract clients to advice is working, and the benefit of advice is resonating with our clients. Investment Management reported annual revenues of $5.4 billion and total assets under management ended the year at $1.3 trillion. While lower asset levels pressured revenues, our results show the diversification of the business and most of its revenues come from durable asset management fees. With the",

The company is making measurable progress, but we still have plenty of work to do. We are keenly focused on value creation and have the right strategy, leadership team, and board oversight to continue increasing the pace of our multiyear transformation.” It was my honor to step into the role of independent chair of the board in January. I look forward to continuing to work closely with my fellow board members, CEO Pat Gelsinger, and the senior management team to carry out our board’s commitment to providing effective oversight of your company and delivering stockholder value. We navigated a challenging environment in 2022 – one that was impacted by a slowdown in demand, increasingly complex geopolitics, an unsettled macroeconomic environment, and our own execution challenges. We are not satisfied with our results, and the board and leadership team are focused on taking the aggressive steps necessary to deliver against our commitments, appropriately manage our capital, and continue to advance our strategy. We are especially focused on striking the right balance between taking the actions needed to deliver on the long-term strategy and managing to near-term realities. Despite our challenges, I am encouraged by the Intel team’s dedication and progress as we work to deliver the process technology leadership, world-class products, atscale manufacturing and cost competitiveness that are central to our strategy. We are clear-eyed about our 2022 results and the hurdles in front of us. We will be disciplined as we execute our turnaround plan. This includes a rigorous focus on reducing costs, driving efficiencies, and managing capital as we move into the next phase of IDM 2.0. Investing with Discipline to Ensure Long-Term Value Creation To drive our strategy forward, it is imperative that we make the right investments for the future of our company. In 2022, we took decisive actions to position Intel for long-term value creation: ▪ Focusing on the optimal pace of capital allocation to balance near-term capacity reduction while investing to regain long-term technology leadership. ▪ Continuing to actively manage our portfolio to unlock additional avenues to create value for our stockholders, such as the initial public offering of our Mobileye business completed in October 2022. ▪ Aggressive steps across the organization to improve Intel’s cost structure and competitiveness. This includes right-sizing the organization where needed. Table of Contents 2 ▪ Implementing a new internal foundry model. This is a significant evolution for the company that will advance our ability to serve our customers as an external foundry, highlight and drive the elimination of legacy costs, and provide more transparency on our financial execution. ▪ Leveraging our Smart Capital approach to capital allocation, including creation of the Semiconductor Co-Investment Program (SCIP). ▪ Resetting our dividend policy in early 2023 to support the investments critical to drive our transformation. This was not a decision we made lightly, and we remain committed to maintaining a competitive dividend. Strengthening Our Board Oversight and Leadership Team Having the right leadership team in place is critical to our transformation. It is essential that the company succeeds in driving a significant cultural and operational evolution throughout the organization, with an emphasis on listening to our customers, delivering against commitments, innovation and value creation. At the board level, we are focused on supporting this evolution and ensuring we have strong governance and the right mix of skills, experiences, and backgrounds to provide rigorous and independent oversight of Intel’s strategy, performance, and culture. As an example of this focus, we welcomed two highly qualified new directors to our board last year. Barbara G. Novick, a co-founder of BlackRock, and Lip-Bu Tan, former CEO of Cadence Design Systems, bring to our board extensive leadership experience and expertise. Our board also refreshed the composition of key committees, with several committee membership rotations and assignments that are detailed in this proxy statement. Under Pat’s leadership, the company meaningfully strengthened our executive management team in 2022 with the appointment of David Zinsner (CFO), Michelle Johnston Holthaus (GM – CCG), Christoph Schell (Chief Commercial Officer), and April Miller Boise (Chief Legal Officer). Commitment to Stockholder Engagement and Responsiveness We remain deeply committed to engaging with our stockholders to garner input from our owners concerning our strategy, capital allocation, compensation, sustainability, and governance practices. In 2022, members of our board and leadership team met with stockholders representing approximately 75% of Intel’s outstanding institutional shares. Our board chair and compensation committee chair personally engaged with over 40% of Intel’s institutionally held shares. We heard clearly from our stockholders that they were concerned about our approach to executive compensation. In response, the compensation committee made several significant changes to our compensation programs in November 2022, resulting in further alignment of pay with long-term stockholder value creation. The board and I sincerely appreciate our stockholders’ constructive feedback, and we look forward to continued engagement over the coming year. On behalf of the entire board, thank you for continuing to invest in Intel and for trusting our board and leadership team as we navigate this critical phase of Intel’s transformation and work to create long-term value for our stockholders.",

Soon after, we transformed our global operating model to better serve our customers. We Hybrid work is a great example. We believe our HP and Poly portfolio, combined with our expansion in
software and services, will help create entirely new customer experiences and expand our
addressable market. We have an equally attractive opportunity to scale our services and

recurring revenue.
To help fund investments in our growth areas, we are simplifying our portfolio and zeroing in on
businesses where we can drive significant competitive advantage and market leadership.
Future Ready Operations
As we strengthen our portfolio, we’re supporting it with Future Ready operations.
A big part of this is continuing the process of digitizing the company. Our infrastructure investments
have driven greater productivity, speed and efficiency. And this new digital backbone is already
improving our execution—from creating a more flexible and resilient supply chain, to further enhancing
our customer support and go-to-market capabilities. It is also enabling new customer value
propositions, such as personalized services and solutions that are key to our growth strategy.
At the same time, we are driving operational excellence across every facet of our business. In a
company of our size, we believe we have opportunities to further improve execution and reduce costs.
And we plan to continue optimizing our performance by unlocking efficiencies, simplifying
organizational structures, and removing unnecessary spend.
Future Ready HP
The road ahead won’t be easy. At times like these, companies must find ways to navigate through
choppy waters while steering their ship toward brighter days.
This is exactly the approach we’re taking at HP—controlling what we can control through disciplined
execution and cost management, while reinvesting in our growth priorities and digital transformation.
All of this will be underpinned by our unwavering commitment to the HP Way. Our people, culture and
values have long been core to our success—and I continue to believe that how we do things is just as
important as what we do. That’s why we’re creating a culture where diverse talent can come to do the
best work of their careers while making a positive impact around the world through our Sustainable

We made significant investments in our IT infrastructure to become a more digital company. And we announced a three-year value creation plan, including a commitment to return $16 billion of capital to our stockholders. Our team executed well against these priorities—and HP is a much stronger company today as a result. We exceeded each of the key targets set in our value creation plan, while significantly reducing our structural costs and strengthening our position in key growth areas. Of course, we also navigated a volatile and complex macro environment. And as we have faced challenges, we have embraced them as opportunities to improve our performance. This is exactly what we did in 2022, and it’s what you can expect from us moving forward. Because as far as we have come as a company, we see significant opportunities ahead to build on our progress and create value for our customers, shareholders and other stakeholders. Fiscal Year 2022 Highlights We delivered solid results in 2022 – with revenue of $63 billion – even in the face of tough market conditions that worsened in the second half of the year. Importantly, our key growth businesses each delivered double-digit organic growth. And we continued to build a more growth-oriented portfolio through M&A with the completion of our acquisition of Poly. We generated non-GAAP free cash flow1 of $3.9 billion, while returning $5.3 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. And we continued to differentiate HP as one of the world’s most trusted brands. This is a key competitive advantage in the market, as more customers make purchasing decisions based on our commitment to climate action, human rights, diversity, equity and inclusion, and digital equity. Our efforts garnered widespread recognition, including the “100 Most Sustainable Companies” by Barronʼs, “Best Workplaces for Women” by Fortune, “America’s Most Just Companies” by JUST Capital and CNBC and, for the fourth consecutive year, “America’s Most Responsible Company” by Newsweek. Our Next Phase of Growth As we look toward the future, our sights are set on unlocking our next phase of value creation and growth. That’s why, last November, we announced our Future Ready plan. It’s designed to develop the portfolio and operational capabilities needed to win in our markets and further reduce our structural costs. We expect to generate at least $1.4 billion in gross annualized run rate savings by the end of our 2025 fiscal year, helping us to mitigate near-term headwinds while maintaining investments in long-term growth. Future Ready Portfolio A key area of investment is focused on building a more growth-oriented portfolio.

Our focus on delivering client value fueled revenue growth of 12% at constant currency in 2022, including about four points from incremental external sales to Kyndryl. Our solid and growing recurring revenue base now represents more than 50% of IBM’s total revenue. And today, more than 70% of our annual revenue is in Software and Consulting. IBM 2022 Annual Report 1 IBM Software revenues were up 12% at constant currency, including about 6 points from incremental sales to Kyndryl. Red Hat, which allows clients to harness the power of opensource software innovations, continues to grow at a healthy rate. Our automation, data and AI and security software have been optimized for this platform and delivered solid growth. IBM Consulting revenues were up 15% at constant currency, driven by clients’ strong demand for our extensive technical and business expertise to accelerate their digital transformation journeys. IBM Infrastructure revenues were up 14% at constant currency, including about 6 points from incremental sales to Kyndryl. Clients continue to leverage IBM zSystems and Distributed Infrastructure platforms as foundational elements of their hybrid cloud infrastructure. This revenue growth and cash generation allowed for both continued investment in the business and shareholder returns. In 2022, we spent more than $2 billion to acquire eight companies and returned nearly $6 billion to stockholders through dividends. Technology and expertise Our perspective on technology is clear and consistent: hybrid cloud and AI are helping to usher in a new era of greater productivity, faster insights, better decision-making, and enhanced employee and customer experiences. That is why we have designed our products and services to maximize the business value of hybrid cloud and AI for our clients. Hybrid cloud has become the leading architecture for enterprises because it offers more value than relying on a single, public cloud. This value takes the form of scale, security, ease of use, flexibility, seamless experiences, and faster innovation cycles. Companies continue to adopt hybrid cloud to unify their data and applications across multiple clouds, on premise, and at the edge. Containers are the preferred destination for hybrid cloud applications and IBM’s container platform, with Red Hat at the core, continues to gain clients. For example, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) adopted a hybrid cloud approach that uses Red Hat technology to manage and scale its infrastructure with greater speed and flexibility. As a result, they delivered hundreds of new applications while reducing provisioning time by 95% and deployment time by 50%. They join organizations like Bharti Airtel, Charles Schwab, Samsung Electronics, and the U.S. Department of Education in working with IBM to realize the value of hybrid cloud. These powerful, hybrid cloud environments also allow clients to infuse AI across their business operations. AI is expected to unlock $16 trillion in value from the global economy by 2030 – including massive boosts in productivity – by scaling data-driven insight and automating business workflows in everything from IT operations and financial reporting to human resources and customer service. Examples include IBM’s work with McDonald’s to automate the drive-thru experience with AI at scale. We also partnered with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to automate the 2 IBM Software IBM Consulting IBM Infrastructure delivery of pension benefits, accelerating the claims process, and freeing up VA staff to focus on higher value work. And BBC Studios is now using our AIOps software to automate the management of its IT infrastructure. To help power hybrid cloud environments, and the AI that runs on them, IBM introduced the z16 platform with an integrated on-chip AI accelerator specifically designed to process and analyze real-time transactions at scale. We also unveiled IBM’s next generation LinuxONE servers, which help clients dramatically reduce data center energy consumption in support of their sustainability goals. IBM Consulting’s business and industry expertise brings these offerings to life for our clients, helping them modernize and manage their applications in a hybrid cloud environment, automate their workflows with data and AI, and meet their security and regulatory requirements. IBM Consulting has strengthened its commitment to be a trusted partner for digital transformation and expanded its use of the IBM Garage – an agile approach to co-creating with clients – with more than 6,700 IBM Garage engagements during the year. For example, IBM Consulting is co-creating with Discover, developing solutions for migrating its systems and applications to an open and flexible hybrid cloud architecture with Red Hat OpenShift. As a result, Discover can automate key business processes and deliver solutions more quickly, improving its customer experience and advancing its overall digital transformation. To complement these offerings, IBM made eight acquisitions in 2022. We added software and consulting capabilities to address specific client challenges, including environmental performance management software (Envizi), cybersecurity attack surface management (Randori), and digital transformation services for the U.S. federal government (Octo). Client engagement: Partnership and co-creation IBM continues to embrace our partner ecosystem as a strategic advantage in delivering value to our clients. In 2022, we made significant progress in bolstering these partnerships, including the introduction of a new skills program to equip partners with the same training and enablement as IBMers, at no cost. The increasing value of our partner ecosystem – to our company, our clients, and the partners themselves – is evident. Business with our strategic partners continues to grow with SAP, Microsoft and AWS all over $1 billion in revenue for the year. We partnered with Amazon Web Services to deliver IBM software as a service on the AWS Marketplace. Our partnership with Microsoft expanded in 2022, with 30 IBM solutions now available on the Microsoft Marketplace and deployable on Microsoft Azure. Meanwhile, Adobe and Salesforce are now leveraging open-source innovation based on Red Hat technologies in their offerings. To ensure clients engage with IBM and its partners simply and efficiently, we made significant changes to our go-to-market model in 2022 and improved our sales productivity. The IBM Sales and IBM Ecosystem functions joined together to create a single, coordinated unit focused on a distinct set of sales plays, deeper technical engagement, and a more experiential approach to selling built around IBM Garages, Innovation Studios, and Client Engineering teams. Exploratory research and applied science IBM Research is driven by our longstanding mission to define the future of computing. Our investments span multiple time horizons and range across all of IBM’s businesses, maintaining a careful balance between exploratory research and applied science. In 2022, IBM Research focused its talent and resources on innovation with practical application, particularly in the areas of hybrid cloud, data and AI, automation, security, semiconductors, and quantum computing. For example, the IBM Telum Processor features on-chip acceleration for AI inferencing in real-time. Today it powers the AI capabilities of the IBM z16, allowing clients to identify fraud at scale in milliseconds. We also pioneered breakthrough innovation in the AI field of large language and foundational models. Project Wisdom for Red Hat Ansible uses foundational AI models to enable developers to generate high-quality code, using plain English, across multiple clouds. IBM Research – like the rest of the company – has embraced partnership and open innovation as it works to solve the most urgent problems of business and society. While we continue to build and maintain a valuable portfolio of intellectual property, we understand that open collaboration with clients, partners, and even competitors can accelerate the realization of value. IBM’s work in quantum computing is a good example of how we blend proprietary and open innovation. In November, we again advanced the fundamental science of quantum computing, unveiling the 433- qubit IBM Osprey processor. This will help us move forward on our roadmap to deliver a 1,000-plus qubit system this year, and a 4,000-plus qubit system in 2025. Our IBM Quantum Network has more than 200 members, with companies like Boeing, HSBC, and Mitsubishi Chemical pursuing potentially industry-changing research. Meanwhile, we continue to provide access to IBM 2022 Annual Report 3 quantum capability through the cloud. More than 1.5 million people have downloaded the free Qiskit software development kit, and an ecosystem of more than 450,000 registered users have developed applications and published papers based on our quantum technology. Environmental, equitable, and ethical impact Both internally, and in our work with clients, IBM aspires to make a lasting, positive impact on the world by protecting the environment, advocating for inclusion, and fostering trust and transparency in both technology and business. In 2022, we announced IBM Impact, a new framework that reflects our approach to creating a more sustainable, equitable, and ethical future. Using this framework, we will continue to set goals, measure progress, and report our results as part of our culture of accountability. We continued to make progress towards our goal of net-zero operational greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. In fact, we have reduced those emissions by 61% since 2010. We are using IBM Sustainability solutions to simplify and automate our sustainability reporting processes. During the year, we were recognized by Boston Consulting Group and TIME Magazine for helping clients turn their sustainability ambitions into actions. IBM demonstrates its commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusivity by creating space and opportunity for everyone at IBM and in society at large. Our diversity practices have resulted in a year-over-year increase of representation for women globally and Black and Hispanic employees in the U.S. We are collaborating with more than 20 Historically Black Colleges and Universities on IBM Cybersecurity Centers to advance STEMbased opportunities. We also continue to narrow the STEM skills gap with our IBM SkillsBuild initiative, adding to our network of 170 partners in our effort to provide access to education and training to 30 million people worldwide by 2030. IBM continues to develop innovation, policy, and practices that prioritize ethics, trust, transparency, and above all, accountability. In 2022, we exceeded our goal to train 1,000 partners in technology ethics. IBM was named to Ethisphere’s list of the most ethical companies in the world for the fourth time. Why the world needs IBM (and IBMers) Today’s IBM is more closely aligned with the needs of our clients. Our engagement model is simpler and more effective. And we have expanded our ecosystem by strengthening existing relationships and forging new, productive partnerships. There is, of course, more to be done. Increasing our levels of productivity will be paramount. To get there, we are infusing our own technology into workflows and processes that span from HR, to finance, to sales and more. We are prioritizing speed and simplicity in our execution while cultivating a highperformance culture designed to ensure every activity is tied to a clear and tangible business outcome. I am proud of the progress we have made as a company and the results we have delivered. And I am especially proud of the IBMers who have made it possible. Because the performance of our business depends entirely on a workforce that is smart, committed, and inspired. That inspiration comes from our belief in the fundamental promise of technology: that when we apply innovation to real-world problems, we drive progress, for both business and society. IBMers deliver on that promise every day. When we help a pharmacy administer more vaccines. When we help reduce the carbon footprint of a retailer. Or when we help prevent a cyberattack on a bank. Today’s IBM is not simply a technology company. We are a problem-solving company and a convener of capability that brings together our colleagues, our clients, and our partners with a simple, open invitation: Let’s create. We do this because we believe that IBM is the catalyst that makes the world work better. And as we have learned over the last several years, the world needs to work better. That is why the world needs IBM, today more than ever.",
66,HCA Healthcare,Health Care: Medical Facilities,"250,500",60233,73107,5643,9.4,HCA,"To our valued shareholders, 2022 was another positive year for HCA Healthcare. Our 182 hospitals and Most importantly, we stayed true to our
mission and values – caring for our patients,
people, and communities.
•	 We cared for over 2 million inpatient
admissions, almost 9 million emergency room
visits, over 1.5 million surgical procedures and
over 200,000 deliveries.
•	 25% of our admissions and 48% of our
emergency room visits were for the treatment
of patients who were either uninsured or
covered under Medicaid.
•	 We provided uncompensated care at an
estimated cost of $3.5 billion.
We believe HCA Healthcare is poised to meet
today's challenges and take advantage of the
opportunities before us.
On the workforce front, HCA Healthcare made
investments in our people this past year. Overall,
we believe our workforce initiatives are starting
to take hold. This past year, we increased
our investment in recruitment to help hire
approximately 105,000 colleagues.
To further bolster our nursing development
programs, HCA Healthcare opened seven more
Galen College of Nursing schools. We expect
to open more schools in 2023. HCA Healthcare
has more than 93,000 registered nurses holding
positions from bedside caregivers to leadership
roles in various healthcare settings and at every
level throughout the organization. Bringing Galen
into the HCA Healthcare family was designed
to combine two leading nursing organizations
to increase access to nursing education
and to provide nursing career development
opportunities for HCA Healthcare colleagues.
In 2022, HCA Healthcare invested more than
$135 million in our clinical education programs,
including centers for clinical advancement. These
investments enhance the learning environment
for our people so we can advance nursing care for
our patients. Workforce development remains a
top priority. We anticipate more investments in
these areas in the future.
As part of our workforce development initiatives
and to help with the country’s issue of physician
shortages, HCA Healthcare has become a
significant provider of medical education. We
have 320 Accreditation Council for Graduate
Medical Education (ACGME) programs, more
than 5,300 residents and fellows, and 66 teaching
hospitals across 16 states.
In addition to growing the pipeline of physicians
and nurses, it's important that we continue
to upgrade our facilities to meet the growing
demand for healthcare. In 2022, HCA Healthcare
invested $4.4 billion in our existing facilities.
That’s the most HCA Healthcare has ever
invested in our capital spending in a single year.
These investments provide us with expanded
capacity, advanced clinical technology, and better
facilities for our patients.
As part of our capital spending, we continued
to expand our outpatient network in key markets.
For example, in 2022, HCA Healthcare purchased
MD Now Urgent Care, a network of 59 urgent
care centers in Florida, which was one of
the largest urgent care acquisitions in the
healthcare industry.
Adding MD Now Urgent Care in Florida enhances
our already strong capabilities in a rapidly
growing state by providing convenient outpatient
care options for our patients. It also connects
MD Now patients to a comprehensive statewide
network of care, including acute care and
specialty services, should they be needed.
2

We also announced plans to build new full-service
hospitals in Texas and Florida to help meet both
states’ growing needs for healthcare services.
These facilities and hospitals would provide more
resources for the communities we serve and help
us deliver the quality care and easier access our
patients deserve.
And while we continued to educate our clinicians,
update our facilities, and grow our networks,
HCA Healthcare continued to remain a leader in
operational and clinical excellence.
We are proud to say that in 2022 Ethisphere
recognized HCA Healthcare as one of the World's
Most Ethical Companies for the 12th time. We
were also recognized for the second consecutive
year on the 2022 LinkedIn Top Companies
ranking, an annual list that helps professionals
identify the top workplaces to grow their careers.
Additionally, we were named by Military Times as
one of the country's best employers based on the
company's efforts to recruit, retain, and support
current and former service members, military
spouses, and military caregivers.
As an organization, we have programs and
initiatives that underscore our strong sense of
purpose to do what is right for our patients,
colleagues, and the communities we serve, and
these awards reflect that culture. As a result,
and thanks to our clinical staff's hard work and
dedication this past year, in the fall 2022,
more than 80% of our hospitals rated by The
Leapfrog Group received an ""A"" or ""B"" Leapfrog
Safety Score.
On the innovation front, HCA Healthcare’s
Care Transformation and Innovation (CT&I)
department is working to deliver the healthcare
of the future and support our care teams. For
example, this past year, we launched a pilot in
the Labor and Delivery (L&D) space – ""Staff
Scheduler."" The Staff Scheduler system predicts
staffing needs based on a machine-learning
algorithm, measures the difficulty of procedures,
and improves staffing according to proficiencies
and preferences. Since the pilot launched, we
have saved time, improved staffing to meet our
patients' needs, and increased nurse satisfaction.
CT&I’s work to identify, build, and roll out new
technology solutions and innovative processes
should create better outcomes and experiences
for our care teams and patients. We look forward
to sharing more of their work.
To further enhance our technology, we decided
to update our clinical systems. This updated
clinical system is designed to provide
HCA Healthcare clinicians with an intuitive,
mobile user interface, personalized to our
workflows. In addition, we expect it will allow us
to standardize our data sets more effectively and
utilize cloud-based analytics to support better
clinical decisions, improve efficiencies, and create
a safer environment for our patients.
And as we continue to innovate and integrate
technology into patient care, we are partnering
with organizations that share our common goal.
For example, we recently partnered with
McKesson Corporation to form an oncology
research joint venture combining McKesson's
U.S. Oncology Research (USOR) and
HCA Healthcare's Sarah Cannon Research
Institute (SCRI). Together, USOR and SCRI
create a fully integrated oncology research
organization with goals to expand clinical
research, accelerate drug development, and
increase availability and access to clinical trials for
community oncology providers and patients. In
addition, this joint venture with McKesson, which
unifies our oncology research experts, is intended
to promote the development of individualized
therapies and provide more opportunities for
cancer patients to receive new treatments.

HCA Healthcare is collaborating with Johnson &
Johnson to address key issues in the healthcare
industry, including improving health outcomes
through early-stage lung cancer detection for
the Black community, providing more resources
for our nurses on health equity issues, and
collaborating on cardiovascular health initiatives.
HCA Healthcare and Johnson & Johnson have
had a long and productive relationship, and both
companies have worked hard to address many
of our country’s healthcare challenges. We are
excited to collaborate to advance health equity,
enhance patient care and provide even greater
support to our nurses.
And in conjunction with the HCA Healthcare
Foundation and the American Heart Association,
we have started a new initiative, Getting to
the Heart of Stroke, to help prevent initial and
recurrent strokes and improve overall stroke care.
This initiative will launch in 15 select
HCA Healthcare markets to empower consumers
to know and better manage stroke risk, deepen
collaboration between healthcare professionals,
and improve the overall health of communities.
Through this collaboration, we hope to have a
significant impact in improving heart and brain
health outcomes in order to beat stroke.
Additionally, we continue to show up for our
colleagues and the communities we serve in their
time of need.
In the aftermath of Hurricane Ian,
HCA Healthcare showed up and supported our
Florida communities. Our human resources and
supply chain teams deployed on-site mini-marts,
fuel stations, showers, and laundry services in
Florida to assist facilities, colleagues, and nearby
health systems in need. In addition, the
HCA Healthcare Hope Fund received 776
applications from colleagues, with more than
$1.2 million being provided to colleagues
impacted by the hurricane. We are incredibly
proud of how our Florida colleagues responded
before, during, and in the wake of Hurricane Ian.
Furthermore, HCA Healthcare and the
HCA Healthcare Foundation showed up
and supported several organizations in our
communities throughout the year. For example,
the Foundation committed approximately $1.38
million over three years to the Girl Scouts of the
USA to provide mental wellness workshops to
girls in grades 4-12 nationwide, over $350,000
to Kentucky flood relief efforts, $600,000
to Volunteers of America over two years to
promote mental wellbeing and resiliency for first
responders and front-line caregivers, $250,000
to the American Red Cross to support disaster
relief and preparedness nationwide, and more.
Through the HCA Healthcare Foundation’s
Healthier Tomorrow Fund, we are also
aligning with strategic partners who share our
goal of creating a more diverse pipeline of
healthcare leaders.
The HCA Healthcare Foundation also committed
to donating $1.35 million over the next three
years to Educate Texas, an initiative of the
Communities Foundation of Texas. This grant
aims to increase access to student programs
that enable healthcare careers, including
high schools in Texas that offer Pathways in
Technology Early College High School (P-TECH)
healthcare career tracks.
We also continued our commitment to support
Historically Black Colleges and Universities
(HBCUs) and Hispanic-Serving Institutions
(HSIs) in communities near our hospitals. As
part of this commitment, we are investing $1.5
million to Florida International University's
Nicole Wertheim College of Nursing & Health
Sciences (NWCNHS) to address the national
nursing shortage. Additionally, we announced
an investment of $750,000 to The University of
Texas at El Paso to advance diversity in healthcare

leadership. HCA Healthcare is also investing $1.55 million to Tennessee State University to fund scholarships
for students pursuing healthcare and computer science careers, and $1.5 million to Fisk University to
support students pursuing the accelerated dual-degree program with Galen College of Nursing.
HCA Healthcare has announced approximately $6.75 million in gifts since 2021 to multiple colleges and
universities as part of our three-year $10 million pledge to HBCUs/HSIs. These partnerships will help
support students pursuing a career in healthcare and, in turn, create a more diverse talent pipeline of
healthcare leaders.
Our dedication to showing up for the communities we serve also includes understanding how the
environment impacts overall health. To help ensure our current and future environmental strategies, like
reducing our carbon emissions, are carried out, HCA Healthcare has robust governance in place to prepare
and execute our sustainability plans.
We look forward to continuing to show up for our colleagues and communities in 2023 and beyond.
As we push forward on our journey to be the provider system of choice, HCA Healthcare announced
organizational changes which, we believe, can be a catalyst for unlocking even more value for our
stakeholders. As of January 1, 2023, we have a new operating model that includes a chief operating
officer, an additional senior vice president-finance, and three operating groups with five domestic
divisions each. The new organizational design reflects a structure that is intended to align better with our
strategy, streamline areas that can improve long-term performance, and provide greater focus and better
coordination in supporting our business. As mentioned previously, the COVID-19 pandemic taught us that
we need to be well-positioned to make timely decisions and act quickly. We believe that’s exactly what this
structural change will do.
All in all, we are coming out of this pandemic with momentum. We believe HCA Healthcare is wellpositioned culturally, competitively, and financially. We are grateful for the hard work and dedication our
colleagues showed this past year in carrying out HCA Healthcare’s mission, and we want to thank them in
advance for what they’re going to accomplish in the year ahead.approximately 2,300 ambulatory sites of care cared for more than 37 million patients. Our people, nearly 294,000 colleagues and 45,000 physicians on our medical staff, fulfilled our core mission by continuing to show up and deliver highquality healthcare services to our communities. The impact of COVID-19 continued to significantly influence the healthcare industry; however, HCA Healthcare performed well by balancing local needs while also developing more enterprise capabilities to support our local networks. As leaders, our actions were informed by lessons learned during the pandemic: the importance of setting clear priorities; the power of teamwork and partnerships; the significance of timely decision-making and execution; and communicating timely and transparently to our stakeholders. The aftermath of the pandemic created a number of industrywide challenges. There has been a clear disruption in the labor market; inflationary pressures have driven up costs; and capacity constraints have affected the ability to meet patient demand. To address these matters, our teams continued to incorporate financial resiliency measures while focusing on four key areas: recruitment, retention, new care models, and capacity management. These initiatives will carry us into 2023. Financially, we ended the year in a solid position. Our revenues for the year totaled $60.2 billion, a 2.5% increase from 2021. We generated $8.5 billion in cash flows from operations, providing us with the capacity to execute a balanced approach to capital allocation. • As you see later in this letter, we invested substantial amounts of capital into our facilities. • We repurchased $7 billion, or over 30 million shares, of common stock. • We increased our quarterly dividend by 17% over 2021. Additionally, we generated over $1.2 billion of pre-tax proceeds from divestitures. And, as a taxpaying healthcare provider, we incurred approximately $5.6 billion of federal, state, and local taxes, including $2.3 billion of income, property, and sales and use taxes.",
67,Prudential Financial,"Insurance: Life, Health (Stock)","39,583",60050,30363,-1438,-2.4,PRU,"Dear Fellow Shareholders, Like many people, I welcomed 2022 with a sense of optimism, buoyed by talk of “transient inflation,” low interest rates, and a constructive stock market. That changed in February when Russia invaded Ukraine. The outbreak of war on Europe’s eastern borders was, within months, followed by a surge in inflation, rapidly increasing interest rates, lower stock and bond market valuations, and growing talk of a Fed-induced recession. Adding to the uncertainty, businesses and employees everywhere began learning how to blend in-person and remote working, as the pandemic gradually morphed into an endemic phase. The pace and breadth of changes in the global economic and fiscal environment once again underscored the financial fragility of billions of people around the globe. And it reinforced for all of us at Prudential the importance of fulfilling our purpose — to make lives better by solving the financial challenges of our changing world. Against that backdrop, we began 2022 by articulating a new vision for Prudential to help employees and other stakeholders understand the company we aspire to become. That vision is for Prudential to be a global leader in expanding access to investing, insurance, and retirement security. In support of this aspiration, we made substantive progress in executing our strategy and implementing the ongoing transformation of Prudential into a higher growth, less market sensitive and more nimble company. Examples of our progress include: • We acquired a 33% interest in AlexForbes, a leading provider of financial advice, retirement, and wealth and asset management in South Africa as part of our programmatic M&A strategy to invest in higher growth businesses. • We reduced the market volatility of our businesses by 20% through the sale of our full-service retirement business and a portion of our legacy traditional variable annuity block. • We achieved our target of $750 million in cost savings one year ahead of schedule. In fact, by the end of 2022 we realized more than $800 million in annual run-rate cost savings. Just as importantly, we intensified our work to identify and seize new opportunities stemming from Prudential’s self-reinforcing business system — a unique combination of differentiated yet interrelated and complementary businesses that includes PGIM, our global asset manager, and our market-leading insurance and retirement businesses. By design, Prudential’s businesses are mutually enhancing. Our insurance and retirement businesses provide a source of growth for PGIM through affiliated flows and access to insurance liabilities that complement its track record of third-party growth. Similarly, PGIM’s diverse asset mix and excellent long-term investment record enable our retail and institutional businesses to offer more competitive products “We made substantive progress in executing our strategy and implementing the ongoing transformation of Prudential into a higher growth, less market sensitive and more nimble company.” 2 Prudential Financial, Inc. 2022 Annual Report that address a wider range of customer needs. By reinforcing and enhancing each other, our businesses also create opportunities to serve customers in new ways, as well as additional sources of growth. As an example, in 2022 we completed the second-largest pension risk transfer transaction in U.S. market history with IBM, providing PGIM with $8 billion in additional assets under management. Changing our business mix Despite the challenging market conditions and economic environment of 2022, our businesses remained resilient and well-positioned, and we continued to invest in opportunities with potential for long-term growth. As part of that work, we are continuing to shift the mix of our U.S. Businesses toward higher growth and less market-sensitive products, while transforming our capabilities and cost structure, and expanding our addressable market. We are changing our business mix through divestitures and, more importantly, through innovation. By offering new and creative product solutions, we are meeting the evolving needs of a broader range of customers. For example, our innovative suite of FlexGuard products is growing in scope and has garnered more than $12 billion in sales since its launch in 2020. Building on that success, in 2022 we introduced FlexGuard Life, which offers a flexible combination of protection, growth and access to meet consumers’ changing life insurance needs. We also continue to invest in our International Businesses. In Japan, our market-leading life insurance companies deliver high-quality service through a differentiated multichannel distribution model. Intent on fueling further growth in Japan, we are expanding our geographic presence and our product portfolio to meet a broader range of customer needs. We continue developing our third-party distribution network in Latin America, particularly in Brazil, where third-party distribution now accounts for about 50% of sales and complements our strong Life Planner channel. In addition, we are expanding our carefully selected portfolio of businesses in emerging markets. We are investing in regions where customer needs are growing, where we see compelling opportunities to build marketleading operations, and where we can add value. Achieving cost savings and improved efficiency The impact of our efforts to transform Prudential into a higher growth and more nimble company is also evident in our achievement of more than $800 million in annual cost savings by the end of 2022. To realize this level of reductions, we assessed every aspect of our company, seeking to streamline and automate how we operate, while investing in advanced technology to improve the experiences of our customers and our employees. This work has yielded numerous benefits: • By embracing a hybrid work model, we reduced our office space footprint in the U.S. by 50%, resulting in annual savings of about $50 million. • Using artificial intelligence, we accelerated underwriting for individual life insurance from 22 days to 22 seconds. • Thanks to a new digital claims processing capability, we can deliver funds to most customers in six hours versus the six days it previously took to complete transactions. Our progress reflects the adoption across the company of a mindset of continuous improvement. This approach is helping us identify and execute cost-savings opportunities on an ongoing basis, while sharpening our competitive edge and delivering better customer experiences and nextgeneration solutions. Investing for growth and delivering shareholder value For nearly 150 years, Prudential’s Rock Solid® balance sheet and disciplined approach to capital management and deployment have helped our company navigate financial and macroeconomic challenges, and deliver on our promises to our customers and other stakeholders. 2022 was no exception. Consistent with our AA financial strength rating, we have maintained a strong capital position, a highquality and well-diversified investment portfolio, and highly liquid assets, which totaled $4.5 billion at the end of the year. As always, we are balancing investing for long-term growth with delivering returns to our shareholders. For example, in 2022 we invested more than $3 billion to drive growth across our businesses, while returning more than $3 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In all, since 2021, we have returned more than $7.5 billion to shareholders. Prudential Financial, Inc. 2022 Annual Report 3 We are continuing to enhance returns to investors. For 2023, our Board of Directors authorized $1 billion in share repurchases, as well as a 4% dividend increase beginning in the first quarter, representing the 15th consecutive annual increase in our dividend. We remain committed to our longstanding capital management philosophy of increasing shareholder distributions as our company grows. Committed to our talent, culture and communities To achieve our vision and create growth over the long term, we must continually strengthen and expand our self-reinforcing business system. As we pursue that objective, we will continue to advance sustainability on multiple fronts. For us, sustainability means attracting, developing and retaining talented employees who share Prudential’s commitment to equity and inclusion. It means maintaining a strong culture of governance and always doing business the right way. It demands we constantly innovate, designing next-generation services and solutions for our customers and clients. It requires us to deliver enhanced value to our shareholders and other stakeholders. And it means caring for our environment and the communities in which we live and work. Our employees are the cornerstone of our success. That is why attracting, developing and retaining outstanding talent is a top priority. We also remain intent on providing an inclusive workplace that offers equitable compensation, career mobility and opportunities for employees to continuously learn and grow. To that end, we are committed to transparency about our compensation practices and to becoming even more inclusive. For example, in our next annual sustainability report, we again will share data detailing the composition of our U.S. workforce by race, ethnicity and gender, and related compensation metrics. We initiated this additional reporting so all our stakeholders — including our employees, investors and customers — can measure our progress and hold us accountable. This objective reflects our purpose and unique company culture, which is based on integrity, respect for one another, and celebrating the diverse perspectives and experiences of our employees. Our commitment to living our purpose also is reflected in our ongoing community involvement and philanthropy, starting in our hometown of Newark, N.J., where Prudential was founded in 1875. Over the past decade, we have invested more than $1.2 billion in Newark to help build thriving neighborhoods across the city and bring financial opportunity to more of its residents. Following the pandemic, we centralized our New Jersey operations in the city as part of our broader commitment as one of its anchor institutions. We also continue to fund improvements to Newark’s public spaces and support its cultural, educational and social institutions. We are also pressing forward to fulfill the commitments we made in 2020 to advance racial equity on behalf of our people, through our businesses, and in society. These commitments reflect our long-standing efforts to drive social progress, close the racial wealth gap, and help build more vibrant and inclusive communities around the world. Confident in our purpose, vision and strategy In 2022, despite an unpredictable and rapidly evolving environment, we advanced our transformation, seized growth opportunities, and stayed focused on serving our customers. Working together, Prudential’s nearly 40,000 employees will continue to build on the progress we made, challenging ourselves to help more customers achieve financial resiliency and deliver increased value to our stakeholders. Prudential’s history — stretching back almost 150 years — is a proud reminder of what we can achieve. Time and again, we have shown we have the foresight and financial strength required to navigate whatever challenges come our way, while continuing to invest for the future. As we look to 2023, we remain grounded in our purpose, confident in our vision and strategy, and optimistic about the opportunities ahead.",

LONG‑TERM PROFITABLE GROWTH
We believe the energy transition and growing global energy
demand will increase Caterpillar’s total addressable market and
represent a significant opportunity for long-term profitable growth
through increasing demand for a wide variety of Caterpillar
products and services.
For example, demand for commodities is expected to increase
due to the growing adoption of electric vehicles, battery storage,
and wind and solar power. Rising global energy demand will
require investments in renewables and many traditional forms
of energy, as well as grid modernization. The energy transition
will also require significant global infrastructure investments,
which expand opportunities for Caterpillar. The opportunities
presented by the energy transition and our work to help our
customers achieve their climate-related objectives led us to add
sustainability as a focus area of our enterprise strategy in 2022.
You can see how we are working with our customers and Cat
dealers to contribute to a lower-carbon future on pages 6 and 7
of this report. You can also read more about our accomplishments
in our 2022 Sustainability Report.
Caterpillar has been a technology leader for nearly a century, and
we continue to invest to meet the needs of our diverse global
customer base. We are increasing our investments in autonomy,
alternative fuels, connectivity and digital, and electrification (AACE).
We have also made strategic acquisitions, such as CarbonPoint
Solutions, which provides customers with carbon-capture
technology, and Tangent Energy Solutions, which monitors grid
patterns and helps our customers with reliable, sustainable
and connected power solutions.

We took transformative steps to advance global health and catalyze greater equity across the healthcare landscape. We put the patient at the center of everything we did as we worked to fulfill our purpose of using the power of leading-edge science to save and improve lives around the world. I am incredibly proud of how our team advanced our pipeline; delivered critical medicines, vaccines and innovative health solutions; and added important innovation through a portfolio of strategic acquisitions, collaborations and partnerships. Our science-led strategy is working, and we are moving with speed, as one team, to deliver value for patients, society and all of our stakeholders. From a scientific standpoint, we made exciting progress in our cardiovascular program and recently shared updates on two promising investigational medicines from our robust pipeline – sotatercept and MK-0616. Sotatercept is a potential first-in-class drug for patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (“PAH”), a rare and ultimately life-threatening disease with a poor prognosis. In fact, the key driver of our acquisition of Acceleron in 2021 was the promise of this important medicine. The readout from our Phase 3 STELLAR trial has been extremely encouraging. Sotatercept exceeded expectations, meeting the primary endpoint and achieving statistical significance on eight of nine secondary outcomes measures. Sotatercept was “Our success in 2022 was underpinned by our understanding that the work we do has a truly profound effect on global health. Throughout the year, we continued to build on our legacy of putting patients first, focusing on how we can address unmet medical needs and work to prevent and treat devastating diseases.” studied as an add-on to PAH background therapy. We’ve also received encouraging results from the Phase 2b trial evaluating MK-0616, an oral PCSK9 inhibitor for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. As a result of these positive data, we plan to move to Phase 3 in the second half of this year. Our progress with sotatercept and MK-0616 is also supplemented by strong momentum in other strategic areas including our Factor XI inhibitor, MK-2060, which received fast-track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in August. Based on these most recent data readouts and the progress we’ve made across our pipeline, we are even more confident in our potential to achieve greater than $10 billion in revenue from our cardiovascular program by the mid-2030s. Oncology products KEYTRUDA, Lenvima, Lynparza and WELIREG are driving key growth for our business, and we remain focused on our expansive oncology research efforts, including moving to earlier stages of disease where there is a higher probability of achieving improved long-term outcomes for patients. In 2022, we continued our momentum, with approvals for KEYTRUDA and Lynparza in additional tumor types and earlier-stage cancers. In collaboration with Moderna, we announced that KEYTRUDA in combination with mRNA4157/V940, a personalized mRNA therapeutic cancer vaccine, received breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA for adjuvant treatment of certain patients with high-risk melanoma. This follows results demonstrating statistically significant recurrence-free survival in the Phase 2b trial studying the combination, the first demonstration of efficacy for an investigational mRNA cancer treatment in a randomized clinical trial. We believe this combination has great potential for patients. We also recently received approval for KEYTRUDA for adjuvant treatment after resection and platinum-based chemotherapy for certain adult patients with non-small cell lung cancer based on the results of KEYNOTE-091, which represents its seventh indication in earlier-stage cancers. Early lung cancer detection and screening remain an important unmet need. It is our ambition, along with stakeholders, to improve lung cancer screening rates to levels similar to other cancer types, such as breast and colon, where screening programs have been more widely adopted. We have made substantial progress in advancing our oncology program through our internal R&D and business development, and we believe that our suite of antibody-drug conjugates and small molecules represent greater than $10 billion of commercial potential by the mid-2030s. This excludes additional innovation we are investing in to expand, deepen and extend our current commercial assets, and does not include the personalized mRNA therapeutic cancer vaccine. Our vaccines business remains a key growth pillar, anchored by our HPV vaccines GARDASIL and GARDASIL 9. We expect our HPV vaccines to continue growing substantially, potentially more than doubling 2021 sales and generating over $11 billion Merck & Co., Inc. 2023 Proxy Statement 3 in revenue by 2030. Additionally, we are advancing our population-specific strategy in pneumococcal vaccines. VAXNEUVANCE is approved in infants, children and adults for protection against invasive pneumococcal disease, and later this year, we look forward to completing the Phase 3 clinical trials from our V116 program for the protection of adults against pneumococcal disease. In December, Instituto Butantan in Brazil – an organization we are collaborating with for vaccine development – reported encouraging topline results for its vaccine candidate to prevent dengue, which will help inform future development of our own dengue vaccine candidate, V181, which uses a similar approach with the same antigenic content. In addition, we have begun a Phase 3 trial of our monoclonal antibody to provide passive immunity against respiratory syncytial virus in infants. Our Animal Health business remained a market leader in 2022, with consistent, above-market growth driven by higher demand in livestock from our ruminant, poultry and swine products. Sales growth in companion animal reflected higher demand for the BRAVECTO parasiticide line of products. We look forward to continuing to build our biopharmaceutical and technology offerings and driving growth, innovation and strong performance in Animal Health. Our business development strategy is helping position Merck for growth well into the next decade and complements our diverse pipeline and product portfolio. In 2022, we executed several important transactions, including the acquisition of Imago Biosciences and collaborations with Orion Corporation, Orna Therapeutics, Moderna Therapeutics and Kelun-Biotech. We will continue to take a disciplined and focused look at opportunities to add novel assets and technologies to our portfolio in 2023. We are delivering on our longstanding commitment to operating responsibly, and in 2022, we continued to make significant progress across our goals of expanding access to health, developing a diverse and inclusive workforce, protecting our environment, and operating with the highest standards of ethics. We expanded access to our innovative portfolio to ensure Merck’s science advances global health. We are more than halfway toward reaching our goal of providing 100 million more people access to our innovative portfolio globally – through access strategies, solutions and partnerships, by 2025. In addition, recognizing the ongoing need for multiple approaches to treat COVID-19, we continued to accelerate global access to LAGEVRIO through our comprehensive supply and access approach. We continued to cultivate a diverse and inclusive workforce, implementing critical strategies and leveraging our 10 employee business resource groups, which represent the various dimensions of diversity that span our company. These groups enhance employee engagement, enable career growth and development, and help ensure we achieve our business objectives. We also made strong progress toward our climate goals and further developed the tools and processes required to reduce our company’s carbon footprint. And, we are committed to conducting ourselves with integrity, fully complying with regulatory requirements. Our success in 2022 was underpinned by our understanding that the work we do has a truly profound effect on global health. Throughout the year, we continued to build on our legacy of putting patients first, focusing on how we can address unmet medical needs and work to prevent and treat devastating diseases. We will continue to leverage our size, scope, scale and strength to invest in our pipeline and capitalize on opportunities that deliver lifesaving and life-changing benefits to patients worldwide, as well as great returns for our shareholders. I am deeply inspired by and proud of the progress we’ve made. Still, I am keenly aware that our work is never done and that patients around the world are waiting for the kind of scientific innovation that Merck can uniquely deliver now and well into the future. In 2022, we also marked the conclusion of a leadership transition as Ken Frazier retired from our company after a distinguished 30-year tenure. Throughout his Merck career, Ken set and exceeded a high bar of excellence in both executive and board leadership. He led with principle, embodied our core values, and made immense contributions to global health. On behalf of our entire company, I want to thank Ken and wish him the best in his next chapter.

70,World Fuel Services,Energy,"5,214",59043,1585,114,0.2,INT,"For almost 40 years we have been providing energy, logistics and finance solutions to global aviation, marine and landbased customers. We are not in the business of producing or refining the energy we supply; instead, we work every day to refine our services, improve access and deliver value through our global network of partners and our own inventory, distribution and sophisticated digital services and products. Our mission is to meet our customers’ energy needs in the most efficient manner possible. We have spent decades building and operating a global solutions ecosystem for transportation, commercial, industrial and governmental end users. Our diverse customer list includes thousands of airlines, airports, private aircraft operators, shipping companies, hospitals, factories, mining companies, municipalities, federal governments and branches of defense agencies in more than 200 countries and territories, all of which require innovative solutions to access and finance their energy and energy transition needs. We supply our customers with jet fuel, marine fuel, diesel, gasoline, lubricants, natural gas, electricity, deicing fluid, renewable and biodiesel, sustainable aviation fuel and dozens of other energy products and services. Quality assurance, logistics, financing, operational integration, price management and reliable and strategic sourcing are key elements of our offering. We strive to make a difference in every aspect of our customer’s energy diet which is then reflected in the health of their core operations. 2022 was a milestone year. We delivered solid performance in every one of our businesses. 2022 also capped a three-year journey where during that time period our business and our team responded to 1) the sudden and near total shutdown of Aviation and Marine passenger travel, 2) the abrupt end of our military business activity in Afghanistan, and 3) the impact of the Ukraine invasion on global oil markets, which negatively impacted our Aviation inventory model. Despite all of this, in 2022 we rebounded back to nearly match our record 2019 operating results. If 2022 says anything about our company, it is that portfolio diversity breeds stability and stability breeds resilience, especially in the face of adversity. Our rebound was attributable to both the improved performance of our legacy core business and our focused acquisition strategy. Our Marine business benefitted from heightened volatility, supply disruption and tightening credit availability and our Aviation business capitalized on the continuing post-pandemic recovery in passenger travel while we rapidly reshaped the inventory business model to mitigate price risk arising from the changes in global oil supply following the invasion of Ukraine. On the acquisition front, we acquired Flyers, a leading operator of low-cost, unmanned gas stations called “cardlocks” that supply diesel and gasoline to light commercial vehicle fleets. Flyers exhibits highly ratable, recurring revenue and solid financial returns and is an excellent strategic fit with our Land portfolio, as it provides us with expanded geographic coverage and enhanced operational density. These actions speak volumes about the grit and determination of our team, our prudent approach to capital allocation and the operational adaptability of our to capital allocation and the operational adaptability of our management culture. This is just the latest chapter of the transformational story of a small intermediary reselling to primarily tier-two airlines and global shipping companies with just over $500 million in sales in 1995 to nearly $60 billion of global sales of conventional, sustainable and digital products and services to more than 100,000 customers worldwide in 2022. Today, we are a global leader in energy logistics, providing a comprehensive and reliable supply of conventional and sustainable energy solutions with numerous digital and analog products and services, including advisory. We have built a trusted global network providing energy solutions and enabling global commerce – a value proposition and platform difficult to replicate. At times we operate like the traditional supermarket, where the customer comes to us at an airport, seaport, or card lock where we have our own inventory or contracted supply. At other times, we deliver to them, either physically or virtually through third parties, at their factory, plant, mine, home, fleet facilities or even directly into their truck’s fuel tanks. We provide surety to the market on the buy and sell side. Each counterparty knows that they have a superior transaction because of our involvement in quality, finance and their operations. We are in the middle of conventional, sustainable and digital energy fulfillment, where we are navigating the economic waters for our customers and balancing decarbonization with energy availability and affordability. We are doing more every day in supporting the efficient generation, innovation and distribution of clean energy, energy efficiency and lower carbon technologies. I often refer to World Fuel as an immigrant company because while we have grown organically, we have also grown through acquisition – giving us the benefit of a diverse group of talented colleagues from around the world with deep domain expertise in energy, logistics and finance. Our team is on the ground in nearly 40 countries, which fosters both a global mindset and a local practicality. This deep connection with our suppliers and customers embeds us in the global community, allowing us to collaborate in unique ways to positively impact the communities where we live and work. It is an approach that has led to trusted partnerships with customers, organizations, and businesses around the world. It is a very exciting time for our company. The diversity of our people and geography mirrors the diversity of our customers and energy solutions leaving us well positioned for the future.

Mexico, Colorado, and Utah utilizing
a combination of new and recently
underutilized existing pipeline assets.
The Texas Western Products (“TW

OFFSHORE SEA PORT
OIL TERMINAL (“SPOT”)
In January 2019, Enterprise submitted
an application to the U.S. Department
of Transportation’s Maritime
Administration (“MARAD”) and the
U.S. Coast Guard (“USCG”) for a
license to construct, own, and operate
a deepwater crude oil port terminal
in the Gulf of Mexico. Our proposed
SPOT project is comprised of a fixed
platform, deepwater port terminal that
will be connected to an onshore crude
oil storage facility with approximately
4.8 MMBbls of capacity in Brazoria
County, Texas. The platform will be
located approximately 30 nautical miles
off the coast of Texas in 115-feet of
water. The platform will be connected
to the onshore storage facility by two
36-inch, bi-directional pipelines. SPOT
is designed to load Very Large Crude
Carriers (“VLCCs”) and other crude
oil tankers at rates up to 85,000 barrels
per hour.Depreciation and Amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) of $9.3 billion. The partnership also generated INVESTING FOR
FUTURE GROWTH
We currently have $5.8 billion of major
capital projects under construction,
scheduled to come into service in
2023–2025. Substantially all of these
projects are underwritten by longterm, fee-based contracts.
Approximately $3.6 billion of
these projects are expected to begin
commercial service during 2023. The
largest project is our second propane
dehydrogenation (“PDH 2”) plant
scheduled to be completed in the
second quarter of 2023. This project
remains on time and on budget. PDH
2 is located at our Chambers County,
Texas complex. It will have the capacity
to convert up to 35 MBPD of propane
into 1.65 billion pounds of high purity,
polymer grade propylene.
Demand for propylene has
historically grown at a rate of 1.4
times that of global gross domestic
product (“GDP”) growth. By
comparison, demand for crude oil
typically grows at approximately half
the rate of global GDP. Propylene
is an important petrochemical
building block for consumer goods
such as durable plastics, consumer
electronics, personal protective
equipment, pharmaceuticals, carpets,
upholstery, and diapers, just to name
a few important consumer staples in
everyday life.
This facility is fully underwritten by
long-term, fee-based agreements. We
have designed PDH 2 to significantly
reduce its carbon footprint and
operating expenses by modifying
the facility to recycle the hydrogen it
produces as a zero-emission fuel source
for the plant.
Enterprise is also building four
natural gas processing plants in the
Permian Basin to facilitate production
growth in the basin. The partnership’s

and the Mentone II plant in the record cash flow whether measured by Adjusted Cash Flow from Operations SPOT is one of the world’s most
environmentally focused energy
infrastructure projects that includes
state-of-the-art pipeline control, vapor
control, and leak detection systems.
SPOT is designed to reduce carbon
dioxide and volatile organic compound
(“VOC”) emissions by approximately
65 percent and 94 percent, respectively,
compared to current industry
practices. It also significantly reduces
spill and collision risk and enhances
overall maritime safety by eliminating
the current industry practice of
ship-to-ship oil transfers, or reverse
lightering, at sea.
Enterprise received the Record of
Decision (“ROD”) from MARAD in
November 2022. We have begun work
to satisfy the remaining conditions and
expect to receive the deepwater port
(“DWP”) license in 2023.
MARAD and the USCG led the
nearly four-year, comprehensive review
of this project. The ROD includes the
opinions of more than a dozen Federal
governmental agencies, including
the Army Corps of Engineers and
Environmental Protection Agency, as
well as reviews and approvals by the
State of Texas. The notable findings
from the ROD included:
“The construction and operation of the
Port is in the national interest because
the Project will benefit employment,
economic growth, and U.S. energy
infrastructure resilience and security.
The Port will provide a reliable source
of crude oil to U.S. allies in the event of
market disruption and have a minimal
impact on the availability and cost of
crude oil in the U.S. domestic market.”
“Construction and operation of an
offshore export terminal and the
installation of a vapor combustion
system at the DWP will reduce the
number of ship-to-ship transfers
of crude oil and lessen emissions
from conventional crude oil loading,
thus providing a more efficient, less
impactful crude oil transport facility
within the offshore waters of the United
States.”
“ENERGY TRANSITION”
VS. “ENERGY ADDITION”
Now, as it has been throughout history,
access to affordable and reliable energy
is critical to human development and
quality of life. Fossil fuels have been
and will continue to be intrinsic to
modern civilization. Noted author and
professor, Vaclav Smil, posits there is
no practical substitute for fossil fuels in
the four pillars of modern civilization:
ammonia-based fertilizers, steel,
cement, and plastics/petrochemicals, as
noted in the diagram above.
The last two centuries have featured
multiple breakthroughs in energy(“Adjusted CFFO”) or Operational Distributable Cash Flow (“Operational development involving coal, then
crude oil and natural gas, followed by
hydroelectric and nuclear, and most
recently wind and solar. Two notable
observations from this history: 1) with
maybe the exception of whale oil, the
world has never “transitioned” away
from one dominant energy source to
another; and 2) access to affordable
energy led to industrialization and the
advancements in science, engineering,
agriculture, and medicine that have
supported rapid population growth
and quality of life. As seen in the graph
above, despite advances in energy, the
world currently burns nearly twice as
much wood (traditional biomass, which
emits more carbon than coal) than it
did in the 1800s. The world’s insatiable
demand for energy is a product of
population growth and desire for better
living conditions in developing regions.
According to the World Population
Prospects 2022 report from the United
Nations, the world’s population reached
8 billion in 2022 and is expected to
peak around 10.4 billion during the
2080’s before remaining at that level
until the end of the century.
We believe in the premise of “energy
addition” or “energy evolution”—
one that features an all-of-the-above
approach to energy. This approach
recognizes the necessity of fossil fuels
in our world; the need to produce,
transport, and consume energy more
responsibly; and the importance of
the addition of low-carbon energy
sources to support the world’s growing
energy needs. We believe the U.S.
energy industry will continue to play a
meaningful role in the coming energy
evolution, both in the context of
cleaner, more efficient operations and
in meeting the needs for affordable,
lower-emission energy solutions.
Our Evolutionary Technology group
has made significant strides since its
formation in May 2021. This group
has identified practical, cost efficient,
and economic projects to lower our
own carbon footprint and support
our customers’ objectives to improve
theirs. Our principal areas of focus
are carbon capture and storage, the
hydrogen/ammonia value chain, low
carbon fuels, and circular products.
We believe these frontier areas will
take a number of years to commercially
develop, construct and implement. DCF”), which were $8.1 billion and $7.6 billion, respectively. Our cash In Closing
Snapshot
The global economy has become more fragile as a result of increasing geopolitical
volatility, trends toward reduced globalization, evolving supply chain challenges, and
low commodity inventories. We believe the United States will still be advantaged due
to our ample and lower cost natural resources, strong bank and financial markets, rule
of law, technological improvements across industries, and “can do” spirit. We believe
Enterprise will continue to innovate in providing essential cost-effective midstream
energy services to our producing and consuming customers, both domestic and
international, and provide attractive returns to our investors.
We are proud 2022 was another record year for Enterprise in terms of safety,
operational, and financial performance. We are grateful for the everyday efforts of our
7,300 employees who facilitated this record performance. We value our employees’

Letter to Our Investors The partnership’s 2022 performance was generated by record volumes across many of our assets, higher margins in our natural gas processing and octane enhancement businesses, and contributions from our February 2022 acquisition of Navitas Midstream, LLC. The Navitas purchase, our largest acquisition since 2014, enabled us to establish a natural gas gathering and processing presence in the Permian’s active Midland Basin. This acquisition was immediately accretive to Enterprise’s cash flow per unit and exceeded our initial expectations. During the year, we increased the value of our partnership by investing $1.4 billion in organic growth capital projects, completing $3.4 billion of acquisitions for Navitas and costefficient purchases of existing pipelines that expand our midstream system, and repurchasing $250 million of our common units while also reducing the principal amount of our senior notes by $1.4 billion.

We also continued our strong commitment to science and innovation investing $7.1 billion in adjusted R&D and today our pipeline includes more than 80 programs across all development stages, which further supports our long-term growth outlook. We have built a strong company since our inception in 2013, transforming AbbVie into a broadly diversified major pharmaceutical company that is powered by growth drivers in immunology, hematologic oncology, neuroscience, aesthetics and eye care. We have grown from 21,000 employees to approximately 50,000 employees globally, while our annual net revenues have grown from $18 billion at launch to more than $58 billion. We have invested more than $55 billion in adjusted R&D and have discovered and developed five blockbuster medicines. Our business performance has created tremendous value for our stakeholders. In our first decade, we delivered a total shareholder return of 613% through the end of 2022 and grew our quarterly dividend by 270%. Critical to our success is our culture of giving back, which is woven into the fabric of our company. In 2022, thousands of AbbVie’s employees participated in our global week of volunteering, and we raised almost $22 million through our annual giving campaign. Since our inception, AbbVie and the AbbVie Foundation have donated almost $650 million to nonprofits around the world. In 2022, we also continued to advance our Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) framework, enhancing disclosures, including publication of our first Task Force for Climate Related Financial Disclosures report, and taking meaningful actions to deliver sustainable solutions for our business and our society. We will share more on our progress in our 2022 ESG Action Report. As AbbVie’s founding CEO, it has been a tremendous privilege to lead our company’s first decade of incredible success. Our future has never been brighter. We have built a strong foundation for the next phase of our journey, and I am confident about our potential to continue to have a remarkable impact on people’s lives, and drive strong performance. Thank you for your support of our important work. I know AbbVie’s next 10 years will be even more exciting and successful than our first 10 years. Sincerely,",

We exited the year in a position of financial strength and well positioned to continue delivering strong operating and financial results. Throughout the year, we executed on our goals and initiatives in a dynamic macro environment. Our integrated business model, flexible asset base and strong execution allowed us to capture increasing volumes from production growth and capitalize on commercial opportunities. As a result, we exceeded our financial guidance while also achieving record health, safety and environmental performance by meeting or exceeding 20% reduction targets in our key metrics. Overall achievements from 2022 include: • Delivered $2.51 billion in Adjusted EBITDA attributable to PAA and Implied Distributable Cash Flow per Common Unit and Common Unit Equivalent of $2.26, exceeding our initial February targets of $2.2 billion and $2.00, respectively; • Generated $1.61 billion in Free Cash Flow, returned approximately $658 million to common equity holders via distributions and unit repurchases, invested approximately $500 million of investment and maintenance capital, repaid $774 million of total debt and achieved a year-end leverage ratio (total debt/adjusted EBITDA) of 3.7x approximately one year earlier than originally planned; • Completed and/or announced several win-win strategic transactions, all of which further optimized our asset base and streamlined our operations; and • Announced multi-year capital allocation framework prioritizing Free Cash Flow generation, financial flexibility and targeting increasing return of capital to equity holders. As we look ahead, we remain constructive on the long-term fundamentals that underpin our business and the need for North American energy, with recent events serving as a reminder that all forms of energy are needed to satisfy growing global energy demand. Underlying supply and demand fundamentals, together with realistic assumptions regarding the growth of various sources of energy, support our belief that hydrocarbons will remain an essential part of the world economy for decades to come. Energy from hydrocarbons will play a key role in supporting a growing global population, reducing poverty, extending longevity and improving overall quality of life. With our network of strategically located North American midstream assets and our focus on the long-term positioning and optimization of our business, we believe we are very well positioned to play a critical role in the delivery of energy across North America and globally. As we do so, we will remain focused on generating meaningful multi-year free cash flow and maintaining a balanced approach to capital allocation that includes debt reduction and increasing returns of capital to equity holders through distribution increases and opportunistic repurchases. We believe the execution of our plan will deliver strong performance and enhanced value for our investors over the long term. We appreciate your continued investment and support and we look forward to your participation in our 2023 annual meeting in May. Sincerely,",

STRATEGY
The transition to a more sustainable economy presents significant
growth opportunities, and lies at the heart of Dow’s innovation and
operational excellence capabilities. In direct response to customer and
consumer needs, we are investing to advance our circular and lowcarbon offerings across our portfolio – which will importantly deliver
additional underlying EBITDA1
 growth – while driving the company
toward zero-carbon emissions across our global asset base.
In 2022, we invested in projects that are expected to deliver
incremental EBITDA1,2 of $400 million, with $300 million from growth
initiatives across our operating segments and $100 million from
efficiency levers. Our 150-kiloton UNIFINITY™ FCDh pilot plant in
Louisiana – which will produce propylene for coatings, electronics
and durables end markets – is mechanically complete and in final
commissioning, and our alkoxylation expansion projects will enable
us to meet demand for higher-value, differentiated applications across
home and consumer care, agricultural and infrastructure end markets.
We also completed 16 silicones incremental debottlenecking projects
to enable higher-performing, more sustainable solutions targeting
mobility, consumer and infrastructure end markets.
We remain on track to improve our underlying EBITDA1,2 by more than
$3 billion across the economic cycle, while reducing greenhouse

 and achieving carbon neutrality4
 by
2050. In Alberta, we are advancing our plan to build the world’s first

2030. This project will grow our global polyethylene supply by 15%
while decarbonizing 20% of our global ethylene capacity, generating
an additional $1 billion of underlying EBITDA.1,2
ACCELERATING OUR LEADERSHIP IN CIRCULARITY
Through investments in key technologies, recycling facilities and
strategic collaborations across the value chain, we are advancing
our circular plastics business platform to meet our customers’ and
stakeholders’ increasing desire for more circular packaging and
specialty plastics, in addition to scaling our ability to produce
higher-value, higher-return recycled and renewable solutions.
To that end, in 2022 we announced several advanced and
mechanical recycling circularity collaborations, including investment
in Valoregen’s largest single hybrid recycling site in France. We
expanded our partnership with Mura Technology to construct
multiple world-scale advanced recycling facilities in the U.S. and
Europe, which will collectively add as much as 600 kilotons of
annual advanced recycling capacity. And we recently announced a
collaboration with WM to improve residential plastic films recycling in
the U.S., which is expected to divert more than 120,000 metric tons of
plastic film from landfills annually.
We also expanded our “Stop the Waste” sustainability target to a
“Transform the Waste” target, with a new commitment to commercialize
3 million metric tons of circular and renewable solutions annually by
2030. When combined with the additional capacity from our project
in Alberta, more than 50% of our global polyethylene capacity will be
circular, renewable or zero-carbon emissions by 2030 – positioning Dow
to lead the circular economy for plastics.

I am proud of Team Dow for their continued commitment to deliver for our customers, shareholders and communities as we strive to deliver value growth by becoming the most innovative, customer-centric, inclusive and sustainable materials science company in the world. RESILIENT PERFORMANCE In the first half of the year, we capitalized on strong end-market demand across our diverse, global portfolio to achieve year-over-year sales growth, while leveraging our derivative and feedstock flexibility and low-cost positions to mitigate higher raw material and energy costs. As economic conditions deteriorated in the second half of 2022, particularly in Europe, we took disciplined actions to prioritize our resources, adjust production rates and reduce costs. We ended the year with net sales of $56.9 billion, net income of $4.6 billion, GAAP earnings per share of $6.28 and operating EBIT1 of $6.6 billion. Building on our earnings foundation, we took specific actions that delivered cash flow from operations of $7.5 billion and free cash flow1 of $5.7 billion, resulting in cash flow conversion1 of 80% of operating EBITDA.1 Our cash generation enabled us to continue to deliver on our financial priorities: • Our CapEx was $1.8 billion and operating return on invested capital1 (ROIC) was 15% as we maintained our focus on safe and reliable operations, and prioritized higher-return, lower-risk and faster-payback projects. • We achieved credit rating and outlook upgrades as a result of our strengthened balance sheet. Currently, we have no substantive long-term debt maturities due until 2027. • We returned $4.3 billion to shareholders, through $2 billion in dividends and $2.3 billion in share repurchases.

76,American International Group,Insurance: Property and Casualty (Stock),"26,200",56437,36948,10276,18.2,AIG,"Dear AIG Shareholder: I am very pleased to share AIG’s 2022 Annual Report with you, our valued In this Annual Report, you will see our dedication to
sustainable value creation, continuous improvement,
balance sheet strength and quality outcomes for
investors — all making AIG an attractive investment.
In a year defined by substantial, global macroeconomic
headwinds, AIG remained focused and we made
remarkable progress in our transformation in ways that
benefitted all stakeholders, including our shareholders.
AIG’s 2022 accomplishments further solidified our
foundation as we continue to position the company for
future growth and as an industry and market leader.
Most importantly, the AIG narrative is about our
commitment to delivering excellence in everything we
do and building for long-term, profitable growth.
Performing in a Complex
Macroeconomic Environment
In 2022, AIG’s total shareholder return (TSR) was
approximately 14%, while the average S&P 500 TSR
was down approximately 18%. Achieving this level of
TSR in a tumultuous market environment is a major
accomplishment in and of itself; and it was only one
of AIG’s many accomplishments.
Against a backdrop of devastating natural disasters
occurring with increased frequency and severity, volatile
equity markets, rising interest rates, global inflationary
concerns, energy shortages and pricing surges,
cybercrime, the Russia/Ukraine conflict, geopolitical
unrest generally, and more, AIG —and the entire global
business community —navigated a commercial
landscape that required agility and adaptability, strategic
thoughtfulness, and conviction in execution.
As a result of the hard work and determination from our
colleagues across the globe, we executed on multiple
strategic priorities and entered 2023 with significant
momentum. We are positioned to capitalize on growth
opportunities and are developing a culture grounded in
alignment around common goals, continuous
improvement, high performance, underwriting and
operational excellence, inclusiveness and integrity.
Creating Value and Positioning
AIG for Growth
Our commitment to continuous improvement is built into
AIG’s Purpose and Values and has been one of the guiding
principles of our turnaround, transformation and future
growth potential.
Improving the core business of AIG and truly transforming
the company was something we knew could not be
accomplished in a single year. It required a commitment to
change across many areas of the company — underwriting,
portfolio derisking, reinsurance, operational processes
and other transformation, talent retention and
development, expense management, digital optimization,
relationships with distribution partners and clients,
regulatory engagement, transparency in communication,
and investments in our communities.
We also knew we had to be patient and have fortitude to
stay the course — even pivoting while navigating a global
pandemic — and that positive results would emerge
over time.shareholder. In this Annual Report, we highlight the journey AIG has been on for the past few Today, AIG is a very different company. We are an industry
and market leader, and we strive to set the standard in all
that we do.
Our 2022 Accomplishments
Over the course of 2022, we made progress on many
fronts, reinforcing our reputation as a company that can
deliver on multiple, complex priorities at the same time.
I am very proud of what our global colleagues accomplished.
Below are a few highlights.
1. Our most significant accomplishment was the
completion of the initial public offering (IPO) of Corebridge
Financial — the largest U.S. IPO in 2022 — in a market
where external dynamics were extremely challenging.
2. We established a standalone capital structure for
Corebridge while deleveraging AIG’s balance sheet. These
actions enhanced the strength of the balance sheets of
both companies and set the foundation for financial
flexibility and delivering on financial commitments made
to our respective shareholders.
3. AIG returned over $6 billion to shareholders through
$5.1 billion of AIG common stock repurchases and $1.0
billion of dividends. We finished the year with 734 million
shares outstanding, a 10% decrease from the end of 2021.
Corebridge paid approximately $300 million of dividends
to its shareholders from the date of its IPO through
year-end 2022.years and our vision for the future. 4. Our General Insurance business delivered the strongest
underwriting profitability AIG has ever achieved, as full
year 2022 underwriting income nearly doubled from the
prior year to $2.0 billion. This translates to more than
$7 billion of cumulative improvement in our underwriting
profitability since 2016.
5. The combined ratio of 91.9% and accident year
combined ratio, as adjusted* (AYCR), of 88.7% improved
3.9 and 2.3 points, respectively, from the prior year. The
latter marked the fulfillment of our goal to achieve a
full year, sub-90 AYCR, following 18 consecutive quarters
of improvement and four sub-90 quarters in 2022.
6. AIG 200, our multi-year effort to improve efficiency
and enhance digital effectiveness, reached significant
milestones, including achieving a modernized technology
infrastructure and operational capabilities, while
executing on exit run-rate savings of $1 billion six months
ahead of schedule.
7. We changed the strategy and structure of our
investment management groups at AIG and Corebridge,
including through partnerships with Blackstone and
BlackRock where we are leveraging their investment
expertise and technology platforms to improve
performance. Since 2021, we transferred management
of approximately $50 billion and $150 billion of assets,
respectively, to each of these partners.
“We made progress on
many fronts, reinforcing our
reputation as a company
that can deliver on multiple,
complex priorities at the
same time.”
8. In 2022, AIG was recognized as one of the 50 most
community-minded companies in the United States by
Points of Light, a nonpartisan, global nonprofit
organization that inspires, equips and mobilizes millions
of people to take action that changes the world.
Leading the Industry with Expertise
The insurance industry has always been critical to the
stability of the global economy. This is certainly true today
in an increasingly complex environment. At AIG, we take
great pride in offering exceptional risk solutions to
our clients and distribution partners, while prudently
managing our balance sheet and volatility We only need to analyze 2022’s Hurricane Ian to
understand the delicate, yet essential, relationship that
insurance carriers, reinsurance providers and distribution
partners have with businesses and individuals across the
globe. Hurricane Ian was a tragic event on a human level
that also left devastating physical damage. From a
humanitarian perspective, AIG rapidly deployed significant
resources to the affected areas and provided immediate
support and infrastructure to help individuals, businesses
and communities rebuild.
Hurricane Ian also proved to be a catalyst that changed
market dynamics even more significantly than expected.
It ultimately led to shifts in the market that required the
industry to rethink capital deployment, reinsurance
strategies and the commensurate changes that needed to
take place in the primary market. The unprecedented levels
of natural catastrophes on a global scale also significantly
impacted the reinsurance market and retrocessional
capacity. This has resulted in an increased cost of capital
for the industry, which impacted almost all lines of
business and territories, regardless of loss experience.
In addition, very little new capital entered the market.
AIG navigated the complex renewal season extremely well.
We knew we were in a strong position heading into
January 1, given the improved quality of our global
portfolio, coupled with our considerable efforts to reduce
our gross portfolio peak exposures, as well as the strong
partnerships we have with reinsurance companies.
AIG Your Ally from Now to Next™
While AIG was transforming its core business, we were
also transforming the company’s culture.
AIG is a Purpose-driven and Values-based company, and
our commitment to our Purpose and Values emerges most
clearly in our culture and how we demonstrate allyship
with our stakeholders. For our clients, distribution
partners, colleagues, communities and more — we help
improve and strengthen where they are today and strive
to help them achieve a more successful future.
We are their allies from now to next.
One of AIG’s greatest examples of allyship is our title
sponsorship of the AIG Women’s Open. AIG is proud to be
the title sponsor of one of the most prestigious and
celebrated championships in women’s golf. We became
the title sponsor of the AIG Women’s Open in 2019
because we appreciate the sport, we appreciate the
athletes, and most importantly, we see an opportunity to
create meaningful, significant and positive change
through our leadership. This sponsorship, and our partnership with The R&A to raise the profile of gender
equity and gender pay equity, has permeated throughout
our company, and has become a meaningful driver behind
our core value of being an ally. Through our partnership
with The R&A, we are elevating the women’s game of golf
and recognizing, highlighting and rewarding the
achievements of these elite athletes.
Our Vision for the Future
AIG’s turnaround, along with the transformation of our
core operations, was impressive for many reasons. We
significantly improved the company, tackling issues that
had not been previously addressed, and the most
important part of the progress we made was building a
core foundation that will enable us to continue to improve
in the future. Having fundamentally changed every part of
the company and delivered exceptional performance on
our underwriting and operational priorities, we have a
renewed sense of purpose and strong momentum. AIG is
very well positioned for 2023 and beyond.
As we look ahead, AIG’s next chapter will be focused on
growing attractive businesses and continuing to shift our
portfolio to deliver the best solutions for our clients while
achieving improved risk-adjusted returns. We will
continuously reposition our portfolio through our
underwriting actions and prudent capital deployment.
The culture of underwriting excellence that we have
created and our broad capabilities to solve risk issues,
coupled with well-capitalized insurance subsidiaries
and a strong balance sheet, provide AIG with significant
flexibility. Additionally, our extensive insight into the
current and evolving risk issues that clients and
distribution partners face every day and ability to connect
across the world through our global footprint provides
us with a competitive advantage.
We continue to work towards the deconsolidation and an
eventual full separation of Corebridge while we reposition
AIG to operate as one, global property & casualty and
personal insurance company. Our goal is to have a simpler
and leaner operating model for AIG with optimized key
end-to-end processes and workflows that allow us to
efficiently deliver high-quality solutions and products to
our clients and distribution partners.
A top priority for AIG in 2023 is to make significant
progress towards reaching a 10% or greater adjusted
return on common equity,* which we will achieve through
continued improvement in underwriting results, expense
reductions from AIG 200, implementing a new operating
model for AIG, ongoing expense discipline, continued
execution of the capital management actions we
accelerated in 2022, and improvement in our net investment income as we continue to reposition our
investment portfolio at more attractive re-investment rates.
Capital management will be a significant area of focus
throughout 2023. We are committed to returning
appropriate levels of capital to shareholders through share
repurchases and dividend payments. In addition to
ordinary-course return of capital, we also expect to use net
proceeds from Corebridge secondary offerings in 2023 to
accelerate our capital management strategy, with share
repurchases being our primary focus. Our target count for
shares outstanding remains 600–650 million and our
target leverage ratio remains 20–25% post deconsolidation
of Corebridge.
Overall, I am extremely proud of what we have
accomplished, particularly in 2022. What our teams have
achieved is remarkable and unprecedented in our
industry. Our journey to become a top-performing
company, delivering excellence in all that we do, will
continue to be our driving force as we focus on long-term,
sustainable value creation for our shareholders.
On behalf of our colleagues around the world, thank you
for your ongoing trust and confidence in AIG.
Sincerely,",
77,American Express,Diversified Financials,"77,300",55625,122734,7514,13.5,AXP,"DEAR SHAREHOLDERS, American Express had an exceptional year in 2022, thanks to the dedication and ingenuity of our talented colleagues. Their unwavering focus to deliver on our vision of providing the world’s best customer experience every day enabled us to continue building long-lasting relationships and deepen engagement with our customers around the world. We entered the year with strong momentum, enabled by the strategic decisions we made to significantly invest in our colleagues, customers and brand, as well as pandemic recovery tailwinds. To build on that momentum, we introduced a new growth plan in January 2022 with the aspiration to grow revenue and earnings over the long term at levels exceeding the already strong growth rates we had delivered before the pandemic. In the first year of our growth plan, total revenues net of interest expense grew 25% to reach a company record of $52.9 billion, and we produced EPS of $9.85, both exceeding the guidance we set at the start of the year of 18% to 20% revenue growth and EPS of $9.25 to $9.65 for 2022. As we entered 2023 with continued momentum across our businesses, American Express is a stronger company today than before the pandemic, and I remain confident that we have the right strategy and the right team in place to pursue our longterm growth aspirations. In reflecting on our team’s outstanding performance, our success comes down to three important assets: our differentiated business model, our talented colleagues who power that model, and our global premium customer base who are at the center of everything we do. Our Differentiated Business Model and Framework for Winning Our business model is unique in the payments industry and provides a number of competitive advantages that, assembled together, are difficult for others to replicate. It is built on our leadership positions in the premium consumer and commercial payments space; our integrated payments platform that connects and builds relationships with both buyers and sellers; our membership model that comprises a broad array of rich benefits; our global position; and our world-renowned brand. In order to most effectively optimize the advantages of our differentiated business model, when I became Chairman and CEO five years ago, my leadership team and I established what we call our Framework for Winning, a strategic document that focuses the organization on a core set of values and priorities that are most important for us to win in the marketplace. The Framework clearly defines our vision and mission, as well as our most critical business imperatives and how we plan to achieve them. Just as important to setting out what we want to achieve, the Framework also articulates how we want to achieve our goals, including the leadership behaviors we expect and the core values that are the foundation of all that we do. This Framework has served as our architecture for running the company, and it evolves as we identify ways to build on our momentum and strengthen our culture. As we mark the end of the fifth year since establishing our Framework, I am proud of the progress we have made across each of our strategic imperatives, leading to the exceptional results we delivered in 2022. We have strengthened our leadership with premium consumers and in the commercial payments space as a result of decisions we made before and during the pandemic to take care of our customers and invest in growth opportunities. We enhanced our consumer value propositions by building out the lifestyle and experiential aspects of our products to attract a broader range of consumers. We also expanded the payment and cash flow solutions we offer small and medium size enterprises to help them grow their businesses. And we invested in growing and strengthening our global merchant network. The results we saw in 2022 demonstrate that our investment in these areas is working. We saw strong momentum in bringing in new customers to the franchise across our consumer and commercial businesses, with proprietary new card acquisitions reaching a record 12.5 million, including record acquisitions of our U.S. Consumer Platinum and Gold cards and U.S. Business Platinum card. Our investments to broaden the lifestyle and experiential aspects of our membership model continued to resonate with younger consumers. In particular, Millennial and Gen Z customers, who are our fastest growing customer cohort in terms of both new account acquisitions and card spending, comprised over 60% of our new consumer proprietary accounts globally. Customer retention remained at high levels, and engagement continued to be strong, with overall Card Member spending increasing 25% (FX-adjusted) for the full year. Across our portfolios, credit performance also continued to be strong, with delinquencies and net write-offs remaining below pre-pandemic levels through the year. We also strengthened our global, integrated network, which underpins our products and services and is a unique differentiator in the payments space. We maintained virtual parity coverage in the United States , while significantly increasing our coverage outside the U.S. We also further modernized our network, which has enabled us to introduce new products, including our firstever consumer digital checking product, as well as launching capabilities that enable fintechs and partners to more seamlessly work with our network. i ii Another key asset for American Express is our global position. Before the pandemic, our international consumer and commercial card issuing businesses were among our fastest growing segments. To accelerate our growth and build scale outside the U.S., we established our new International Card Services Group in 2022, bringing together the international consumer and small business card issuing businesses under a unified team. The Power of Team Amex Our success in executing against our strategic priorities has been and will continue to be powered by our more than 77,000 colleagues around the world. They are the heart and soul of our organization, and they work with commitment and passion to deliver on our vision. That is why we consider the most important part of our Framework for Winning our priority to attract, develop and engage the best colleagues – not just in our own sector but across all industries – who live our Blue Box Values. Our Blue Box Values define what we stand for and guide how we operate. They reinforce our focus on backing our customers, our respect for each other, our commitments to embracing diversity and standing for equity and inclusion, and most importantly, doing what is right. To back our colleagues, we continued to invest in them in 2022, building on the wide range of learning and development opportunities and enhancing our competitive benefits in key areas, including holistic health and wellness, total compensation, and flexibility. As a result, 90% of our colleagues said in a recent survey that the benefits and programs offered by American Express support their well-being, and 92% would recommend our company as a great place to work. Additionally, 89% of colleagues said they have a feeling of belonging at American Express, an increase from the prior year. We were pleased to achieve our results in a year in which we all transitioned to our new way of working. In planning our return to our offices after the pandemic, we wanted to retain the best of what we learned working virtually while also recapturing the benefits of working together in person. To that end, last year we launched Amex Flex, our new working model that gives colleagues the ability to work fully virtual, fully in an office, or a hybrid schedule. As we mark the first anniversary of Amex Flex, I am pleased that while the way we work has evolved, our culture has endured. A majority of our colleagues have selected a hybrid schedule, which means they have chosen to come into an office on certain days and work virtually on the others, while other colleagues have chosen to be mostly or entirely virtual. Our flexible approach is a key differentiator for us, and our continuous efforts to create an inclusive culture that embraces diversity has continued to earn us accolades. In 2022, American Express ranked No. 8 on the 100 Best Companies to Work For list in the U.S. by Great Place to Work and Fortune magazine and ranked similarly high on several other workplace lists outside the U.S. The company also ranked No. 13 on Fortune’s list of the World’s Most Admired Companies. To remain competitive, we will continue to listen and evolve our approach to deliver the best experience for our colleagues so that they can deliver the best experience for our customers. Backing Our Customers Our customers are at the center of everything we do, and they represent one of our most critical competitive advantages in the fast-growing payments space. We are leaders in the most attractive customer segments in the industry, including premium consumers, small and medium-sized businesses, and the largest corporations around the world. Our focus on these segments has enabled American Express to create a virtuous cycle of growth that starts with our premium customers. The high levels of engagement that we drive with our customers enables us to attract a growing network of merchants and partners, who add more value to our membership model, which in turn enables us to attract more premium customers, creating more scale. This scale enables us to generate more investment capacity and operating efficiencies to continue building our membership model, making it difficult for our competitors to catch up. What’s truly special about our business is the relationship that our customers have with our brand. Many of our customers don’t see themselves as simply having or using American Express® cards. They feel they are with American Express. Our customers have a strong emotional connection to our brand and the products and services we offer. They are proud of their association with us. I often have people tell me how long they’ve been a member when I first meet them. As we have continuously evolved our membership model by adding more offerings, benefits, experiences and digital solutions to meet the changing needs and expectations of our customers, the power of our brand endures and remains relevant across generations. I’m proud that our colleagues’ continued commitment to customer-focused product innovation and delivering a great customer experience that once again earned our team top accolades. In 2022, customers rated American Express No. 1 in customer satisfaction in the J.D. Power U.S. Credit Card Satisfaction Study among national credit card issuers, landing the top spot for the 12th time in the 16 years since the survey began. Customers also rated us No. 1 in the J.D. Power U.S. Small Business Credit Card Satisfaction Study for the second year in a row. iii We see many opportunities ahead for our business, and we intend to capture these opportunities and build on our momentum by continuing to invest at high levels in several key areas, including further innovating our consumer and small business products; growing merchant acceptance with a particular focus outside the U.S.; introducing new digital capabilities that deliver seamless customer experiences in their channels of choice; and expanding into adjacent areas that reinforce our core membership model, including new lifestyle and financial services for consumers and SMEs. Remaining Focused Looking ahead, we are focused on building on our momentum to achieve our long-term growth aspirations and remaining disciplined and nimble to meet our customers’ evolving needs. While there are uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment, we have the right strategy and team in place to navigate changes in the operating environment should they occur. Our company has shown resiliency in the face of disruption throughout the years, including more recent events like the September 11 terrorist attacks, the Great Financial Crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Each time, we have emerged a stronger, more focused company, and that is because of our commitment to backing our colleagues and our customers. Having just completed my fifth year as Chairman and CEO, I have never felt more inspired and proud to lead American Express and the incredibly talented colleagues who make our company so special. We have numerous opportunities ahead to continue deepening and strengthening our relationships with our customers. I am confident that by staying true to our vision, focusing on our strategic imperatives, and living our Blue Box Values, American Express will continue to succeed well into the future.",
78,Publix Super Markets,Food and Drug Stores,"242,000",54942,,2918,5.3,,"Dear Stockholders and Associates, Our founder George Jenkins, affectionately known as Mr. George, believed if you treat associates right, they’ll take care of the customer, and the rest will take care of itself. We still believe that today and continually look for ways to build connections with our associates and improve their experiences with Publix. In this report, you’ll see how we’re bringing Mr. George’s philosophy to life through our associates and for the customers and communities we serve. Our associates Our associates are the backbone that supports Publix. It’s through their efforts and dedication that we’re able to continue to be successful. Starting new chapters After 35 years of dedicated service, Chris Litz, Vice President of Product Business Development for Bakery and Meat, retired at the end of May. He led and supported strategic efforts to improve our operations and service to our customers. After 30 years of dedicated service, Gino DiGrazia, Vice President of Finance, retired at the end of last year. His commitment to helping our retail and support business units understand their operations made us a better company. After 45 years of dedicated service, Sam Pero, Lakeland Division Vice President, also retired at the end of last year. He trained and mentored countless associates and was committed to serving his customers and communities in times of need. After 28 years of dedicated service, Linda Kane, Vice President of Benefits Administration and Assistant Secretary, retired at the end of last month. She committed her career to providing a comprehensive and affordable benefits package for our associates and their families. After 47 years of dedicated service, Chuck Roskovich, Charlotte Division Vice President, announced his decision to retire at the end of this month. He has made significant contributions in almost all of our divisions and has led the way for our new market entry in our Atlanta and Charlotte divisions. We appreciate the passion and commitment these leaders displayed throughout their careers to make Publix better. We also look forward to what our newly promoted officers — Lakeland Division Vice President Marsha Singh, Vice President of Benefits Administration Monica Allman and Charlotte Division Vice President Joey Riddle — will accomplish as they move forward in their careers. Improving our company We know the best way to build culture and connections is by being together. That’s why we were excited to start holding family night and new store opening events again. We also brought together all our store managers and support directors for our retail operations conference, after holding smaller meetings in 2021 due to the pandemic. Another way we’re connecting and improving our company is by sharing ideas through Idea Spot, our internal platform for associate suggestions. We are actively reviewing over 1,000 ideas. 2 Celebrating together At our annual meeting last year, we announced the creation of the Carol Jenkins Barnett and Publix Community Service Scholarship. Two Publix associates beginning their freshman year of college this fall are each being awarded $5,000 toward their education. Through this scholarship, we will celebrate and honor Carol’s life and work. In 2022, we celebrated members of our Publix family with our three highest awards. The George W. Jenkins Award recipients were Curt Epperson, Jenniffer Kras, Steve Myers, Phil Postle, Mark Taggart and Philip Wearsch. The President’s Award recipients were Julian Agollari, Nicolla Binford, Kris Crapo, Allie Holberg, Caven Morgan and Dawne Steinbach. The Mr. George Community Service Award recipients were Rhett Bagwell, Stacy Bidwell, Melanie Bonanno, Kelsey Palmer, Ben Robb and Erika Serkin. We presented 15 pharmacy associates with the Rxcellence Award for excelling in customer service, performance, ownership and teamwork. Drug Store News also named three of our associates to its annual list of Top Women in Health, Wellness & Beauty. The honorees in the Rising Stars category were Jacque Rusch and Julie Lalicon. Kathy Leonard was recognized with the Business Excellence Award for the second year in a row. Progressive Grocer named five of our associates to its annual Top Women in Grocery list. Renee Kelly received the Senior-Level Executive honor; Donna Huska received the Rising Stars honor; and Store Manager honorees included Christine Lambiase, Jennifer Lomastro and Crystal Marlow. In August, several of our truck drivers competed in their state’s truck driving championships. On top of his win in Florida, Truck Driver David Guinn won his division at the American Trucking Associations’ National Truck Driving Championship in Indianapolis. You can find information on the recognitions our associates received, and more, by visiting our newsroom at www.publix.com/newsroom. To help recognize our associates’ efforts to make Publix a great place to work, we held companywide celebrations and provided associates with Publix gift cards throughout the year. While our associates still received their service award gift during the pandemic, last year, we brought back our luncheons and dinners for those celebrating milestone Publix anniversaries. Associates with five to 15 consecutive years of service enjoyed luncheons in their districts or business areas. Those with 20 or more years of service were honored at dinner events in their divisions. Our customers Treating our customers like royalty remains our focus. We continue to explore and implement ways to meet our customers where and how they want to shop with us. Providing convenience In August, we rolled out curbside pickup for prescriptions at our stores with pharmacies in Florida, Georgia, Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. In September, we launched the ability for customers to purchase Publix digital gift cards and send them through email for anyone to use at their Publix or online for in-store pickup. They can even be added to their Club Publix wallet for future use. 3 Creating loyalty Newsweek magazine recognized Club Publix on its America’s Best Loyalty Programs list in the Supermarkets subcategory as well as the Pharmacies and Drugstores subcategory. Launched in 2020, this membership program offers exclusive member perks and personalized content. While Club Publix helps create personalized experiences online, our retail associates are the ones who create those experiences in our stores. Last year, we recognized one store in each division that excelled at providing premier service with the Customer Service Excellence Award. They were #424, Palm Bay, Florida; #791, Mulberry, Florida; #1508, Moody, Alabama; #1559, Oviedo, Florida; and #1615, Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina. Our communities Mr. George believed in the importance of building a thriving community and conserving our resources. We continue to follow his philosophies in being responsible citizens in our communities and intolerant of waste. Feeding our neighbors As part of our Feeding More Together campaign, our customers and associates donate at the register, and Publix matches their contributions with an equivalent value of fresh produce. Since the start of this campaign in 2021, we’ve provided more than 232 million meals to help feed our neighbors in need. Since 2009 as part of our perishable recovery program, we’ve given more than 650 million meals to our neighbors in need through Feeding America member food banks and other nonprofit organizations. We continue to evaluate how to give more by analyzing food that is still good to eat but unsalable. We’ve been able to expand the types of food we’re donating, and we’ve added new methods that can be used to transport the food, allowing for more frequent pickups from our stores. Last year, during Hunger Action Month in September, Publix Super Markets Charities announced a $5.65 million donation to 328 food banks and other nonprofit organizations focused on hunger alleviation. In a joint effort, Publix and Publix Charities announced plans to do more good together to alleviate hunger. Publix Charities donated an additional $3.85 million to 22 Feeding America member food banks for each to purchase and equip a mobile food pantry to help provide fresh food to the people they serve. As part of Publix’s investment in our communities, we will provide more than 10 million pounds of produce to stock 20 of the mobile pantries in their first year of operation. Through these collective efforts, individuals will be able to shop these free pantries for the food that meets their needs. To further support hunger alleviation efforts, nearly 6,300 associates volunteered with more than 200 nonprofit organizations throughout our operating area during our fall Publix Serves Week. And at the end of last month, we hosted a hunger summit with Feeding America member food banks in our operating area. The summit’s goal was to provide a forum for open discussion and sharing of best practices in different areas important to their success, including logistics, warehousing and transportation. This was an opportunity to build stronger connections and, together, find better ways to accomplish a united purpose — feeding even more people in need in the communities we serve. Improving the environment Mr. George was in a green routine before it was popular, and for decades, we’ve focused on ways to reduce, reuse and recycle because we know how important it is for our environment. We’ve focused our sustainability efforts on five pillars: water stewardship, plastics and packaging, energy conservation, landfill diversion and responsible sourcing. We consistently implement initiatives to support those pillars, from evaluating low-irrigation landscaping to working to convert recycled plastic bags to furniture. 4 Last year, Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary in the western Everglades and the saline glades region in the eastern section of the Everglades National Park began seeing the effects of a portion of our $2 million donation — water has returned to areas that needed it, allowing wildlife to survive and thrive in their natural habitat. For the sixth year in a row, we supported the restoration of damaged Florida watersheds by donating to the Arbor Day Foundation. Our donation allowed for planting 126,000 longleaf pine saplings near north central Florida, areas nearly stripped of trees by Hurricane Michael in 2018. Since 2016, more than 730,000 trees have been planted in four damaged Florida watersheds through our donations. We also enhanced our commitment to marine life conservation by collaborating with Sustainable Fisheries Partnership (SFP) to analyze and understand current fishing practices within the supply chain. Last year was our 12th year donating to SFP. Over that time, we’ve contributed more than $600,000 to support fishery and aquaculture improvement projects and other initiatives to advance the sustainability of seafood. Among other efforts, we were the first U.S. retailer to join with SFP, BirdLife International and Whale and Dolphin Conservation to review and understand the risks from the unintended catch of ocean wildlife within the seafood sourcing supply chain. Publix provided additional support toward efforts to test innovative new fishing gear, improve data collection and increase monitoring to protect sharks, whales and sea turtles. And last March, more than 6,200 associates throughout our operating area volunteered at more than 220 state parks and other nonprofit organizations focused on environmental sustainability during our spring Publix Serves Week. You will see our efforts again this month as we continue to be responsible citizens in our communities. Making a difference in lives Publix and Publix Charities donated $200,000 to support the education and well-being of students at 10 colleges and universities in the communities we serve. We collaborated with the United Negro College Fund for the second year, and last year, we provided $100,000 in scholarships to 50 minority students attending these schools. In addition, Publix donated $50,000 in food and other products, and Publix Charities donated $50,000 in funding to support food pantries serving students at the schools. Owning a home can make all the difference to a family. Publix Charities donated $5 million to support more than 240 nonprofit housing programs throughout the Southeast, including 126 Habitat for Humanity affiliates. The generosity that comes from our Publix family is special. Last year, our customers and associates gave nearly $30 million in total at the register to Children’s Miracle Network, Feeding More Together, March of Dimes, Special Olympics and Tools for Back to School. We were also recognized as the March of Dimes’ No. 1 corporate partner for the seventh straight year. Mr. George believed one of the most efficient ways to help our communities was through United Way. Last summer, United Way named Publix its No. 1 Global Corporate Leader for the third year in a row for the total contribution our associates and Publix Charities gave for our 2021 campaign. For our 2022 campaign, our associates pledged $29.1 million. Being there when crisis hits Being a responsible citizen sometimes comes in times of crisis. Last year, our customers and associates donated more than $2.3 million at the register to support Red Cross relief efforts in Florida, Kentucky, South Carolina, Puerto Rico, and Ukraine and its neighboring countries. Publix Charities also donated $1.2 million to the American Red Cross, United Way and other nonprofit organizations to support relief efforts. I am proud of our associates who work hard to care for our customers, our communities and each other every day. 5 Our accolades As company owners, we’re most proud of the difference our associates make. Many organizations also see the Publix difference. Here are some highlights:  Fortune’s 100 Best Companies to Work For for 25 years — one of four companies to be on the list every year since its inception in 1998.  PEOPLE’s Companies that Care.  Forbes’ America’s Best Employers by State for Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Alabama and Tennessee.  Newsweek’s America’s Best Retailers.  Newsweek’s America’s Best Customer Service. Our 2022 performance In 2022, we achieved sales of $54.5 billion, a 13.6% increase over 2021. Excluding the impact of unrealized gains and losses on equity securities, our net earnings in 2022 were $4 billion, up 12.7% from 2021, and earnings per share increased to $1.20 from $1.04 the previous year, adjusted for the effect of the stock split. All of these results benefited from 2022 being a 53-week fiscal year. As of March 1, 2023, our stock price was $14.55 as compared to $13.76 on March 1, 2022, adjusted for the effect of the stock split. Our success allowed us to continue to invest in our stores. In 2022, we opened 40 new stores and closed 11 for a net gain of 29. We also remodeled 117 stores. In September 2021, we announced signing a lease for our first store in Kentucky — our eighth state. Last June, we broke ground on that store, and by the end of 2022, we’d announced our fourth location in the commonwealth — three in Louisville and one in Lexington. And to help support our growth, we began shipping from our new Greensboro, North Carolina, distribution center. Our pride What our associates were able to accomplish in 2022 was amazing. I’m proud of the work they do to support each other, their customers and their communities, and I’m sure, as company owners, you are too. Because of our associates’ efforts to create experiences our customers want and products they love, Publix can continue to grow. I’m excited about our future and introducing the Publix difference to new associates and new customers. Thank you for all you do.",
79,Charter Communications,Telecommunications,"101,700",54022,60477,5055,9.4,CHTR,"DEAR SHAREHOLDERS: We continued to execute well within a challenging market environment in 2022, As we look forward to the rest
of 2023, we are focused on three
broad initiatives: Evolution,
Expansion and Execution.
EVOLUTION
In 2023, we will progress toward
our goal of offering symmetrical
and multi-gigabit speeds across
our footprint. By the end of
2025, we expect that over 85%
of our footprint will be capable
of delivering 5 Gbps download
speeds, with at least 1 Gbps
upload speeds, with many areas
offering 10x1 Gbps service. We will
deploy these new speed offerings
at a faster pace and at a much
lower cost than our competition,
with an estimated deployment
cost of just $100 per passing.
Additionally, we are evolving our
go-to-market approach with
increasing convergence of our
Internet and mobile products.
In 2022, we launched Spectrum
One, a high-value package that
combines our Internet, Advanced
WiFi and mobile products into one
product, delivering the fastest,
most seamless connectivity. Our
new converged offering helped
drive strong growth in mobile
lines in 2022. The potential for our
mobile product to be a significant
driver of new Internet sales
remains largely untapped, but we
are confident that our converged
offering will drive Internet
sales over time as we continue
to educate consumers on the
Spectrum One value proposition.growing customer relationships, revenue and Adjusted EBITDA.  For the full EXPANSION
Our second area of focus is the
expansion of our footprint. Line
extension construction is an
important part of our 2023 and
beyond growth plan. It offers
good growth and returns visibility,
and is a compelling alternative
to M&A. The initial results of
our rural construction initiative
have been very promising, with
120,000 new subsidized rural
passings constructed in 2022,2
 and
penetration of passings open at
least six months averaging about
40%. In 2023, the pace of new
rural passing construction will
accelerate, and we plan to bid on
additional state and local grants.
We also expect to participate
in the $42.5 billion Broadband
Equity, Access and Deployment
(BEAD) Program, assuming a
reasonable regulatory framework.
Additionally, we remain focused on
expansion opportunities inside our
existing footprint.
Ultimately, our rural construction
initiative is not only good for the
millions of rural consumers that
will finally have access to fast and
reliable Internet, but it is also good
for Charter and its shareholders.
The expansion of our footprint will
help us drive additional customer
growth and strong financial returns.
EXECUTION
Finally, we remain focused on
executing our core operating
strategy – further improving the
customer experience, raising
customer satisfaction and driving
customer growth. In 2023, we will
continue to invest in areas that
enhance the customer experience,
including the continued
digitization of our customer
service model, accelerating our
proactive maintenance initiative
and investing in training and
tenure for our employees. We
believe that further improving the
customer experience will reduce
transactions across the network,
making Charter more efficient
and producing longer-tenured
customers.
We have a successful operating
model to address the opportunities
in front of us. It is the same strategy
that we have deployed for years.
It involves having the fastest
connectivity, and products, pricing
and packaging that are difficult to
replicate by our competitors. We
believe this model ultimately year 2022, we added 344,000 net new Internet customers despite the previous leads to higher penetration
across our passings and the
placement of more products into
the households we serve, which
when combined with high-quality
service, drives higher, long-term
recurring cash flow.
In closing, the outlook for Charter
remains very bright, and I am
both honored and excited by
the opportunity to continue
to help Charter grow and to
create shareholder value as the
company’s new Chief Executive
Officer. It has been a privilege for
all of us at Charter to work for and
learn from Tom Rutledge over the
last 10+ years. His leadership as
CEO is the reason Charter exists
as it does today. He has always
encouraged all of us at Charter
to keep reinventing cable. We’re
fortunate that he will continue to
serve as our Executive Chairman.
Additionally, I would like to thank
all of our employees for their
dedication to our customers
and to Charter. The hard work of
Charter’s over 100,000 employees
has been remarkable. I would also
like to thank all our investors for
their continued support.

Thanks to their determination, perseverance, and unwavering commitment to our customers, partners, and to each other, we ended the year strong. We set several new records for the company including product orders, ending backlog, net income, EPS, Annualized Recurring Revenue (ARR), and Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO). These were strong results, particularly considering the incredibly dynamic environment in which we continue to operate. This tells me that our investments in accelerated innovation, continued strong customer demand, and our ability to execute with excellence, put us in a position of strength for the year ahead, and beyond. We were delighted to engage with our customers in person once again at Cisco Live and other events throughout the year, and we continue to hear that their technology priorities have become even more urgent. In this massively distributed world of hybrid work and hybrid cloud, the Internet of Things is exploding, more and more devices are being connected via the network, and the cyber threat landscape is shifting and expanding. Our customers need to reimagine their applications, power hybrid work, secure their enterprise, and transform their infrastructure. We are committed to being a trusted partner on their digital transformation journeys and doing all we can to help them succeed. Navigating through turbulent times Cisco has been in business for almost 40 years, so we are no stranger to challenging times. The extraordinary events of this past year—including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, significant supply constraints, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and rising inflation—have only reinforced our focus on what matters most: helping our customers and partners, our people, and the communities in which we operate. It has become clear to me that dealing with increasing complexity is the new reality for all of us. What is also clear is that technology is an essential driver of productivity and economic growth. We have the opportunity—and the responsibility—to leverage the power of technology in this new reality, to continue to drive transformation and to solve some of the world’s biggest problems. I am confident the decisions we made and the multiple actions we took over the past two years are helping to offset cost inflation and improve our resiliency. These include adding new and leveraging alternative suppliers, redesigning hundreds of products to use available components with similar capabilities, targeted price increases, and several other creative solutions, all of which position us well for the future. The combination of these actions with the tremendous efforts of our world-class supply chain and engineering teams, and the investments we have made in building capacity to meet growth, has the potential to drive continued momentum into fiscal 2023. Investing in innovation Enterprises everywhere need secure, agile networks that can accommodate distributed users, devices, data, and applications. Our latest cloud-delivered innovations across our networking, security, collaboration, and optimized applications portfolios are designed to help organizations drive productivity and resiliency. They include cloud management for the Catalyst switching portfolio from the Meraki dashboard; a Nexus Cloud SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) offer powered by Intersight to help our customers deploy and manage their Nexus data center networks from the cloud; and the Cisco Security Cloud, designed to be the most open security platform available, enabling customers to connect their end-toend security architecture. In fiscal 2022, we unveiled our vision for Cisco Predictive Networks, an industry first predictive analytics engine for network management which will gather and integrate data from many sources, learn patterns to predict user experience issues, and provide problem-solving options. In June, we introduced ThousandEyes WAN Insights, which we will make available to our SD-WAN customers as the first step towards delivering on this vision. Customers are rearchitecting their applications and they need modern tools to help them do this. We launched Panoptica and Calisti, two new cloud-native, API-first tools for faster and better application development, as well as AppDynamics Cloud, a cloud-native observability “Technology is an essential driver of productivity and economic growth. We have the opportunity—and the responsibility—to leverage the power of technology in this new reality, to continue to drive transformation and to solve some of the world’s biggest problems.” Chuck Robbins Chair and Chief Executive Officer 2 Cisco 2022 Annual Report platform for modern applications which helps remediate application performance issues with business context and insights. And, for customers operating mass-scale networks, we introduced an enhanced routed optical networking platform which can help drive savings of up to 45% in power and up to 70% in real estate required for equipment. Our Silicon One based Cisco 8000 routers, the fastest growing product family in Cisco’s history, combined with optics from Acacia, create a durable foundation for the development of the Internet for the Future, 400G and beyond. These innovations, together with many others across our portfolio, are intended to drive simplicity and provide the best unified experience for our customers. Offering our customers choice is an important factor in that experience, and we continue to find ways to do so through flexible consumption models, disaggregating and virtualizing certain technologies, and delivering as much as we can as-a-Service. Cisco+ Secure Connect, which allows customers to quickly deploy Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) and eases day-to-day operations through a cloud-managed platform, is a great example and the latest of several as-a-service offers, and we have more in the pipeline. Successfully transforming our business We continue to make solid progress in our business transformation which we believe is strengthening our position in the market by helping us to deliver innovation and choice for our customers in new ways, all while giving us greater visibility, resiliency, and predictability. In fiscal 2022, we generated over $15 billion of software revenue, 81% of which was subscription-based. Total subscription revenue, including services sold as subscriptions, was over $22 billion, and represented 43% of Cisco’s total revenue. Our subscription revenue drives ARR and RPO which are the best indicators of our progress in our business transformation. The combination of our ARR, RPO and our record backlog gives us excellent visibility and a high degree of confidence in our future revenues. Living our purpose Since the beginning, Cisco has focused on innovation, integrity and doing what’s right. By operating a successful business, we are empowered to step up to the many societal and environmental challenges we see around the world. We redefined our purpose—to power an inclusive future for all—in 2020, and we couldn’t have imagined how relevant it would be in today’s world. To help fulfill our purpose, we leverage our technology and catalyze our networks, partners, and people to make a positive impact in communities worldwide and on the planet. Our purpose guides us to focus our efforts where we know we can make most impact. This past year, we committed to reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across our value chain by 2040. We recently refined our goals and near-term targets and were one of the first technology and hardware equipment companies to have its net-zero goals validated under the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) Net-Zero Standard, the world's first framework for corporate net-zero target setting in line with climate science. The use of our sold products is the greatest contributor to our overall carbon footprint, so improving the energy efficiency of our hardware and solutions—by integrating Silicon One across our portfolio, for example—is a high priority, as it also helps our customers meet their own emissions reduction goals. We also remain committed to doing all we can to provide inclusive access to training and education in the key digital skills that are in such high demand across all industries. In the 25 years since we launched the Cisco Networking Academy in 1997, we have reached more than 17 million students, 95% of whom say the program helped them obtain a job or educational opportunity. This past year, to accommodate even more students, we created SkillsForAll.com, providing free online technology courses backed by Cisco’s expertise and connected to real career paths in the digital economy. I'm incredibly proud of how our teams around the world have rallied around our purpose. During this past year, more than 80% of employees have given back to their communities. I have no doubt that our purpose-driven culture is a primary reason why Cisco has been named the number one Great Place to Work in 14 countries around the world. While we continue to make good progress on our priorities and work in service of our purpose, we recognize there is always much more to be done to ensure that people and ecosystems can thrive together on a liveable planet. Confidence in the future As we enter fiscal 2023, we see tremendous opportunity ahead. While we expect supply chain challenges to persist, we are encouraged by the early signs of supply easing that we saw at the end of fiscal 2022, and we expect to see gradual improvements throughout the year that will enable us to get our products into our customers’ hands faster. We will continue to focus on simplification as we develop our platform strategy and offerings, while helping to drive sustainability in our products. There is a greater sense of urgency from our customers and partners to leverage leading-edge technologies to deliver on their strategic objectives and our innovation is helping them navigate an increasing amount of complexity. While no company is immune to macro trends, we are fortunate that there are currently more technology transitions occurring concurrently than I’ve seen in 20 years. Given the strength of our portfolio, our continued investment in accelerated innovation, and the commitment of our teams, we believe the multi-year megatrends of hybrid cloud, hybrid work, security, IoT, 400G and beyond, 5G and Wi-Fi 6, as well as the move towards application observability, will provide tailwinds to our long-term growth. We also believe that the focus on sustainability and the climate crisis will continue to be positive for our business. We feel that Cisco is well positioned for whatever the future may hold. Thank you for your continued support.",

by Purpose-Driven People
People are the key to success. The pandemic has changed the
ways and places that people work. Allstate is adapting to these
changes by approaching employees as customers who are
team members.
• Employees are “purchasing” a career opportunity that includes
professional growth, compensation, flexibility, inclusivity, and an
opportunity to make a difference. They “pay” for this with their
expertise, engagement, and commitment.
• Flexibility to work remotely or hybrid is an increasingly important
part of the employee value proposition. Commuting is overrated
and no one wants to drive to an office for a Zoom call. As a result,
Allstate has embraced the concept of flexibility with over 80% of
U.S. employees choosing remote work. This significantly reduces
real estate costs but does impact collaboration and belonging.
• New ways of collaborating and creating a sense of belonging
are being developed given the extent of remote work. Allstate’s
culture is a foundation for success so this legacy must be
protected while adapting to a new work environment.
• Inclusive diversity and equity also drive belonging and
commitment and improve business outcomes. Allstate’s
leadership position was advanced with improvements in
representation, business practices and community engagement.
• These results were delivered by a team that successfully dealt
with business challenges, innovated, and managed leadership
transitions. The Board of Directors provides invaluable wisdom
and perspective to help an outstanding team. Don Civgin retired
as Vice Chair in May after 13 years. Rhonda Ferguson’s passing
in May stunned all of us and the team rallied to fulfill the Chief
Legal Officer’s responsibilities. Glenn Shapiro also retired, staying
until September to support these transitionsenvironment in 2022 to mitigate negative financial results while 2022 Operating Performance
The decline in financial performance did not reflect the agility and
precision of operating results.
• The underwriting loss was generated from auto insurance as
costs to repair and replace cars and settle third-party liability
claims increased by over 15% from the prior year. Increases in the
estimates for auto losses from pre-2022 claims also negatively
impacted 2022 results. The comprehensive program to improve
auto insurance margins includes Allstate brand rate increases of
16.9%, expense reductions, tighter underwriting standards and
adapting claims practices to a high inflation environment.
• Homeowners insurance continued its industry leading
performance generating $681 million of underwriting income,
while growing policies in force by 1.4%.
• Investment results were strong in a difficult year. A proactive
approach to investing reduced exposure to higher interest rates,
which avoided $2 billion of declines in the portfolio’s market
value. While the overall portfolio had a negative 4% return for
the year, this was better than the Bloomberg Intermediate
Bond and the S&P 500 equity indices which declined by 9% and
18%, respectively.
• The Protection Services businesses served more customers with
broader protection and had strong operating results. Protection
Plans’ written premiums increased by 5% to $1.9 billion and had
$150 million of Adjusted Net Income (ANI). Health and Benefits
generated $222 million of ANI.
• Shareholders received cash of $3.4 billion of which $926 million
was dividends, which were increased by 5% per share. Relative
ownership per share increased by 6.1% in 2022 reflecting
share repurchases.staying on course to build a low-cost digital protection company. Financial results were Climate Strategy
Increased severe weather, the transition to a lower carbon economy
and higher societal expectations of business require us to incorporate
climate change into strategy and operating plans. Climate change
affects all four stakeholders covered by Our Shared Purpose.
• Customers need affordable protection from severe weather
and greater resiliency and disaster response capacity.
Electrification of the auto fleet also needs to be reflected in auto
insurance coverages.
• Shareholders require a sustainable business that adapts to
external changes while delivering growth and attractive returns.
New investment opportunities will be realized with the transition
to a lower carbon economy.
• Allstaters value the opportunity to help customers, seize new
business opportunities and improve society since these lead to
professional growth and stable employment.
• Communities want businesses to utilize their capabilities to
create a better future and they reward them by buying their
products.
Allstate has successfully adapted to increased severe weather change
for over a quarter of a century. As a result, the homeowners business
provides coverage to more than 7 million homes, and paid out over
$11.4 billion in catastrophe losses while averaging $644 million of
underwriting income annually over the last five years. Allstate also
helped create public risk sharing pools in Florida, Texas, and California
to provide customers with affordable protection for uninsurable risks.
Expertise and relationships are being expanded to find attractive
investment opportunities from the transition to a lower carbon
economy. In 2022, a commitment was made to achieve net zero
emissions for Scope 1 and 2 measures by 2030. Scope 3 measures
that cover the investment portfolio currently lack consistency and
therefore these targets will not be established until 2025.
Creating the Future
Allstate seeks to create the future, not just react to trends.
Transformative Growth in the property-liability business will
improve the customer value proposition with affordable, simple,
and connected protection. Becoming the lowest cost auto and
home insurer will increase market share but requires significant
operational changes, which are well underway.
Transformative Growth has five components and Allstate made
significant progress in 2022.
• Improve Customer Value Proposition – Affordability was
improved by lowering operating expenses. A new, digital auto
insurance product was launched in two states and is expected
to become available to about one-third of the U.S. through direct
distribution in 2023.below expectations with a net loss of $1.4 billion that resulted from auto insurance • Expand and Enhance Distribution – Allstate brand products
are available through Allstate agents, call centers and online
with pricing that reflects the cost and value of each channel.
National General continues to expand its relationship with
independent agents.
• Lower Customer Acquisition Costs – Strides were made in
improving marketing effectiveness, which will be critical when
marketing increases as auto insurance profitability improves.
• Build New Technology Ecosystems – A new product
management system was deployed with the new auto insurance
product, increasing agility and enabling the eventual retirement
of legacy technology systems.
• Enhance Organizational Capabilities - Digital, analytical
and technology capabilities were expanded to accelerate
transformation. Focus on improving decision clarity
enhanced execution.
The Protection Services businesses also focused on creating the
future. Protection Plans expanded into the furniture category and
new international markets, building on its success in consumer
electronics with U.S. retailers. Health and Benefits is implementing
a new operating platform and expanding from worksite offerings
to direct sales to individuals. Identity Protection upgraded its
technology platform and expanded protection offerings.
Corporate Stewardship
Allstate is one of the largest “main street” protection companies in
the U.S., serving over 189 million policyholders. We have grown into
this responsibility since the first policy insured a 1930 Studebaker
92 years ago by focusing on customers and broadly defining our
role in society. Our Shared Purpose and the Societal Engagement
Framework provide clarity and structure to assess trade-offs
between conflicting objectives. Allstate’s legacy is built on the
fortitude to lead when needed, while limiting our role to the
requirements of Our Shared Purpose.
The Allstate Foundation is also embedded in our history with
70 years of improving communities. Last year thousands of nonprofits were supported to disrupt the cycle of relationship abuse,
empower youth through service and advance economic mobility for
people of color.
Your support makes it possible for Allstate to build on this legacy,
be forward-looking and live Our Shared Purpose. Together we are
making a difference in the world!underwriting losses and a decline in the value of public equity investments. A comprehensive plan to increase auto insurance margins is well underway and margins are expected to increase.

retail environment, our Associates around the world delivered excellent performance. In times like
these, our  exible, off-price business model continues to prove its strength and resilience, as we have
seen throughout our 46-year history. We are a value leader in all of the countries where we operate
as we remain focused on our mission to deliver great value to our customers every day. In 2022,
our great values on rapidly changing selections of quality, fashionable, brand name, and designer
merchandise continued to resonate with a broad range of fashion- and value-conscious consumers
across the globe.
Associate Recognition
We are truly grateful to our Associates for their continued commitment to TJX and our customers.
Our global store, distribution center, and ful llment center Associates who come into work every day
to bring our business to life for our customers deserve special recognition for their hard work and
dedication.
2022 Business Review
In 2022, overall TJX sales closed in on the $50-billion mark, reaching $49.9 billion, an increase of 3%
versus the prior year. We saw total sales growth in both the U.S. overall and our international divisions.
During the year, our apparel businesses, including accessories, across the Company were strong. U.S.
comparable store sales at Marmaxx and HomeGoods combined were  at versus a very strong 17%
U.S. open-only comparable store sales increase last year. We saw strength at TJX Canada and believe
that TJX International performed better than many other retailers in a dif cult retail environment. Net
income for the full year grew to $3.5 billion, a Company record. Earnings per share were $2.97, a 10%
increase versus $2.70 last year. Adjusted earnings per share of $3.11 increased 9% over last year’s
adjusted earnings per share of $2.85.1
 Overall pretax pro t margin was 9.3% and adjusted pretax
pro t margin was 9.7%.2
 Pro tability improved over last year despite incremental freight and wage
costs, although was slightly below our expectations due to a negative impact from inventory shrink.
Long term, we continue to see many opportunities to gain market share in all of our geographies and
keep improving our pro tability.
Throughout 2022, our global buying, planning, distribution, and store operations teams worked
together as “One TJX” to deliver shoppers exciting and rapidly changing assortments of apparel,
accessories, and home merchandise at great value every day. We stayed focused on the off-price
fundamentals and leveraged our leadership in  exibility and global presence. Our organization of over
1,200 buyers sourced from a universe of approximately 21,000 vendors in 2022 to take advantage of
the best opportunities and hottest trends in the marketplace. As a result, we delivered a consistent
 ow of quality, branded merchandise at excellent value to our stores and online all year long. Our
broad range of good, better, and best brands continued to appeal to customers spanning a wide
demographic reach, and our teams did an excellent job with both buying and retailing the goods.
Our off-price treasure hunt continued to provide customers a shopping experience that is both
entertaining and inspires shopping ideas. With this, our customer satisfaction scores remained very
strong. We were a gift-giving shopping destination for the holiday season and see year-round gift
giving as another opportunity for our business.
TO OUR FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS:
1
We are extremely pleased with the performance of Marmaxx, our largest division, which drove a
comparable store sales increase of 3% over 13% open-only comp sales growth in 2021. Total
Marmaxx divisional sales, including Sierra, reached $30 billion and segment pro t margin was 12.7%.
As expected, sales at our home businesses, including HomeGoods, were softer following two straight
years of extraordinary consumer focus on home categories. Long term, we continue to see great
potential to grow HomeGoods’ stores and for pro tability to improve signi cantly. At TJX Canada,
net sales were nearly $5 billion and segment pro t margin increased to a very strong 14%. TJX
International’s sales surpassed $6 billion and segment pro t margin improved over the prior year. As
to e-commerce, while it represents a very small percentage of our overall net sales, it allows us to
offer shoppers our great brands and values 24 hours a day.
Financial Position and Shareholder Distributions
In 2022, we generated $4.1 billion in operating cash  ow and ended the year with $5.5 billion of cash
on our consolidated balance sheet. We enter the new year with a very strong balance sheet and plenty
of liquidity to run the business. We continue to be in an excellent position to invest in the growth of our
business while simultaneously returning signi cant cash to our shareholders.
We were pleased to return $3.6 billion to shareholders through our buyback and dividend programs
in 2022, which is the most we have returned to shareholders over a one-year period in our 46-year
history. In March 2023, our Board of Directors approved a 13% increase in our quarterly dividend, to
33.25 cents per share—marking our 26th dividend increase in the last 27 years. Further, we plan to
buy back an additional $2.0 to $2.5 billion of TJX stock in 2023. We have bought back over $28 billion
in TJX stock over the past 26 years.
Looking Forward
Again, we are so proud of the outstanding performance and execution of our teams in 2022, and we
enter 2023 in a position of strength. We are convinced that the characteristics of our business and
the depth of talent in our organization set us apart from many other major retailers and will allow us to
capitalize on the opportunities we see to further grow our top and bottom lines. Thanks to the talent of
our world-class buyers, strong vendor relationships, global buying presence,  exibility, and  nancial
liquidity, we are in an excellent position to capitalize on the phenomenal availability of merchandise
we see in the marketplace. We are con dent that we will continue to have plenty of quality, branded
goods available to us and we will continue to offer consumers around the world great values and
freshness every day. We also remain focused on our sales and pro tability initiatives, including looking
for ways to mitigate inventory shrink. We are con dent in our current plans to improve our pro tability
this year and to reach our pretax pro t margin target of 10.6% by 2024 (Fiscal 2025). Longer term, we
are con dent that we are on track to becoming an increasingly profi table, $60 billion-plus revenue
company.
Corporate Responsibility
During 2022, our corporate responsibility priorities continued to focus on areas such as Associate wellbeing, inclusion and diversity (I&D), and environmental sustainability. Our environmental sustainability
teams around the globe have been focused on the expanded and accelerated global goals that we
announced in April 2022. These include goals to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions in our
operations by 2040 and to source 100% renewable energy for our purchased electricity by 2030, as
well as targets around operational waste and packaging.
2
Supporting I&D also continues to be a core focus of our corporate responsibility program. Our global
teams developed and launched many initiatives to support our three global I&D strategies,
including recruitment strategies, training and education, Associate-led I&D advisory boards,
and additional Associate Resource Groups. As in previous years, our commitment to I&D extends
to our community giving program as well, and in 2022, we continued to support nonpro t
 organizations working toward racial justice through new grants to a number of national organizations.
Altogether, through our charitable giving and with the generous contributions of our customers and
Associates during 2022, we supported more than 2,000 organizations globally, across a range of
important causes. As just a few examples, our charitable giving program allowed these organizations
around the world to provide more than 25 million meals to individuals experiencing food insecurity, to
assist in the aftermath of global natural disasters, and to offer relief efforts in Ukraine.
Consistent with our corporate values, in 2022, we announced and completed the divestiture of our
minority stake in Russian off-price retailer Familia.
On our corporate website, TJX.com, we provide further information on our ongoing global corporate
responsibility efforts, as well as our business operations and  nancial results.3
Board of Directors and Our Gratitude
We also want to thank Zein Abdalla for his many years of service to the TJX Board of Directors from
2012 until June 2022. Zein made numerous contributions to our Company over the years. We wish
 Zein success in his future endeavors and the best for him and his family.
Finally, we would like to again thank our global Associates for their efforts, hard work, and dedication.
We are also grateful to our customers for their loyal shopping visits and to our fellow shareholders,
vendors, and other business associates for their support throughout the year.  We want to extend our sincere gratitude to John F. (“Jack”) O’Brien who stepped away from the
Board of Directors due to illness last year. Jack made signicant contributions to TJX over his
more than 25 years on our Board. He served as our Lead Independent Director for 18 years and
served on other key committees at various times throughout his tenure. His deep nancial
expertise and strong business acumen provided lasting value to the growth of our business,
including launching in new regions and adding new retail banners. On behalf of TJX and the entire
Board of Directors, we are forever grateful to Jack for his service to our organization, and wish
Jack and his family all the best. ",
88,Progressive,Insurance: Property and Casualty (Stock),"55,063",49611,83743,722,1.5,PGR,,"non-acquisition-oriented customer services and support. We use non-acquisition expense ratio (NAER) as the key measure of operational efficiency. NAER is calculated by taking our overall expense ratio and subtracting media costs and agent commissions. Our Personal Lines and Property NAER for 2022 was down approximately 0.2 points and 0.3 points, respectively, from 2021, while Commercial Lines NAER was up approximately 0.2 points in 2022 versus 2021. We believe we maintain some of the most competitive NAERs in the industry, which naturally supports competitive prices that allow us to grow. We balance our loss adjustment expense (LAE) with providing excellent service and claims accuracy, paying the right amount for every claim. We continually try to manage to the optimal combination of these three principles along with strong engagement and work environment for our employees. While we are pleased with our relative competitive position around NAER and LAE, we recognize the ratios benefited from higher written premium per policy in 2022. Our employees are one of our most significant expenses and, at year-end 2022, the ratio of our policies in force to headcount was 8% lower than at year-end 2021. We are focused on making our processes more efficient and building experiences to be more conducive to self-service to improve productivity and operational efficiency going forward. Taking a holistic view, our 2022 companywide expense ratio was 18.5 points, or 1.1 points lower than in 2021. While we had some improvement in our NAER, as we navigated the effects of Hurricane Ian and sustained loss trends, we reduced our media budget to help ensure we achieved our aggregate calendar year 96 combined ratio. Another important facet of competitive prices is to be able to price rate to risk through our product models and strong segmentation. Our investment in product development is a key tactic to accomplish that. In auto, we launched our newest product model, which we refer to as 8.8. By the end of 2022, we had this product model rolled out in 10 states, which represented over 25% of our 2022 countrywide NPW and almost 27% of our policies in force. Within our commercial auto product, we completed 25 commercial auto model upgrades during the year and our latest product design, 8.0, at year end 2022 was deployed in 37 states that represented nearly 85% of our countrywide premium. Our 8.0 product model greatly improves segmentation, delivering lower rates for the best risks while also introducing several new coverages. In stark contrast to the commercial auto industry, we believe that our continued rate actions over the last few years have enabled us to consistently stay ahead of net trend, ensuring consistent profitable growth. In Property, we continue to invest heavily in the development of our next product model (5.0), which will also provide improvement in segmentation. The first state is expected to launch in the second quarter of 2023. As we head into 2023, we will continue to invest in technology and process improvements, to attempt to push non-acquisition expense ratios lower, and in talent to continue to improve our segmentation acumen. ONWARD AND UPWARD While Hurricane Ian was certainly a gut punch to so many, there are always silver linings and the note sent to me below proves what it means to live our Core Values, specifically the Golden Rule. Good Morning Tricia, I wanted to take a moment to tell you how blessed I feel to be able to work for such an amazing Company. I like many was hit by the recent hurricane Ian. Words can’t begin to describe the feelings you have during such an event. Within two hours of the storm I lost all power, cell phones went down as well as Internet. The ability to have any communication cut off is the most unsettling feeling I think I have ever experienced. I was lucky to have a great group of neighbors and we rallied together in one house to brave the storm. After a long afternoon and night when the storm had passed one neighbor had cell service. I was able to alert my family and loved ones finally that I was OK. I viewed my emails to see over 20 emails from Progressive trying to check if I was ok as well from my direct Supervisor Vincent. The first glance at the devastating damages was beyond overwhelming. Over the next week so many people reached out to me from Progressive to see what they could do to help. Crysti from HR was amazing as she talked with me every day even if it was to say a kind word. She was so supportive and uplifting. Rob, our senior claims leader, called as well as texted to let me know what ever I needed Progressive was there for me. Vincent was amazing. He was in constant contact with me two to three times a day offering whatever he could do to help even offering to drive two hours to bring gas to me as gas was almost impossible to get. He went above and beyond. As the weeks have past and the rebuild is ongoing, I still tear up thinking about Progressive and the people I work with. They are my Family. People say when things are really bad that is when you find out what people are made of. That being said Progressive people are amazing, kind, caring, and most of all selfless. I am so proud to say I work for Progressive and for sure Progressive works for me. Thank you for your time in reading this. I felt it was important to know how blessed Progressive is to have such amazing people work for them. God bless. Notes like this, and reflecting on these past three years, I can’t tell you how enthusiastic I am to dive into 2023. We believe we are well prepared and positioned. This is what we do—execute on deliberate and cogent plans with room for flexibility as the unknowns inevitably occur. Words do not do justice to literally every single area of Progressive that contributed to this year and the prior years that I have referenced. Instead of calling out every group, because I’m certain I would accidentally overlook an area, I just want to say that I am so grateful and proud of all of Progressive’s people. My sincere appreciation for all of your hard work and dedication is something that I never take for granted. While we deemed 2022 “The Year of You,” I want every one of you to know that I believe that is the case every year. Every success starts with you because of your passion and pride. Thank you. In addition, thanks to our partners, agents, and, most importantly, our customers who we are so privileged to serve. Stay well and be kind to others"

91,Performance Food Group,Wholesalers: Food and Grocery,"34,825",47194,9422,113,0.2,PFGC," Dear stockholder During fiscal 2022, Performance Food Group (“PFG”) surpassed major milestones and reinforced our position as one of the world’s leading food and foodservice distribution companies. Our organization successfully grew despite macro-economic pressure, showing the resiliency of our strategy. Our focus on meeting the customer where they want allows us to increase our market share in the U.S. restaurant space and win new customer accounts across a range of channels. Our strategy is underpinned by a relentless focus on expanding across North America through both organic growth and strategic transactions. We took a big step forward in this journey by closing the Core-Mark transaction during the fiscal first quarter of 2022. Since the closing, we have made significant progress integrating Core-Mark. We are encouraged by their smooth transition into PFG’s family of companies and the early business success. By combining Core-Mark’s strength in the convenience store (c-store) space with PFG’s foodservice expertise, we have been able to create a strong pipeline of c-store business opportunities. This has translated into wins across the c-store space and boosted our sales and profit results. We remain confident that the Core-Mark transaction is well on its way to creating significant stockholder value over the long-term. In fiscal 2022 we also delivered on an important milestone in our journey to become a leader in the Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) space. During the fiscal year, PFG published its second annual ESG report, which established our company’s first set of ESG goals. At PFG, we believe that being a leading steward for the environment, our community, and our organization will be part of what defines our long-term success. Our strategy and our dedicated associates led to a successful business performance for PFG. In fiscal 2022, we achieved total net sales of $50.9 billion and exceeded the $1 billion mark in Adjusted EBITDA for the first time in our company’s history. Our fiscal 2022 financial results include: n Total case volume growth of 29% n Net sales increased 67% to $50.9 billion n Gross profit improved 49% to $5.3 billion n Net Income of $112.5 million n Adjusted EBITDA increased 63% to $1 billion1 n Diluted Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) of $0.74 The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Core-Mark and growth in cases sold and an increase in price per case as a result of inflation. The gross profit increase was led by the acquisition of Core-Mark, which contributed gross profit of $846.5 million for fiscal 2022. Also, gross profit increased due to an increase in gross profit per case driven by inflation and case growth in Foodservice, particularly in the independent channel. ACQUISITIONS AND INTEGRATIONS PFG’s history as a disciplined and proven acquirer has been an important element of our growth strategy over the past several years. Reinhart Foodservice is now fully integrated within our Foodservice segment and has contributed excellent results, and in many areas Reinhart is now growing faster than our legacy business. I am incredibly pleased with the ongoing efforts across our organization to make this important transaction the success that it has become. Successful integration of acquisitions has allowed our company to augment our organic growth strategy to create additional stockholder value. The next opportunity for this value creation, we believe, will come from the already-strong and continuing contributions from the Core-Mark acquisition. We look forward to continued success with the Core-Mark team. SUCCESSFULLY NAVIGATING THE MARKETPLACE The past several years have certainly presented unique challenges for our industry, customers and associates. The past 12 months have seen a disrupted supply chain, high food-cost inflation and rising fuel prices. Throughout it all, the dedication of PFG’s associates has allowed our company to manage the challenges and build a stronger, more resilient organization. We believe this will serve us well for the years ahead. I see a bright future for PFG and thank our entire organization for making that possible. Best regards,",

People are expressing a deeper appreciation for their health and wellness. And the definition of sport continues to expand, inviting more and more of us into fitness, movement and play. Sports also remain a powerful source of hope and inspiration. In challenging times, it’s sport that unites us, bringing us together across families, cities and nations. The joy created by sport builds community and connection – transforming lives like little else can. Our passion for sport continues to fuel our journey as a growth company. We serve consumers worldwide with industry-leading innovative products they love, driving growth and competitive separation. Indeed, FY23 was a milestone year for us, as we delivered on our operational and financial goals. We exceeded $50 billion in revenue, representing strong double-digit growth for the year on a currency neutral basis. This growth was broad-based across our consumer construct of Men’s, Women’s and Kids’ and across the spectrum of performance and lifestyle. In addition, our geographies and our portfolio of brands – Nike, Jordan and Converse – all achieved strong growth. Jordan Brand had a particularly impressive FY23, with strength in its most important growth opportunities, like Women’s, apparel and international. And critically, we returned to healthy inventory, ahead of the competition. The decisive actions we’ve taken to prioritize a healthy pull market have positioned us for more profitable growth moving forward. There’s no question that FY23 was a special year for our greatest advantage: innovation. Sport remains our differentiator. We make athletes better by inspiring and enabling them throughout their lifelong sport journeys. As athletes look to us to help them achieve their personal bests, our relentless pipeline of innovative product creates – and expands – the separation between us and our competition. For instance, we fueled growth through our industry-leading performance product in Global Football, led by the Mercurial, Nike’s fastest football boot. This summer’s World Cup represents the exciting debut of the Phantom Luna, our most innovative women’s-led football boot ever. And our World Cup kits are introducing significant fit and material innovations mapped to a woman’s specific movements. In Basketball, the LeBron XX was the strongest LeBron launch in years, fueled by storytelling and the blend of innovation with sportswear design. The Sabrina 1 offers female players a unique traction pattern designed for the playmaking abilities of WNBA All-Star Sabrina Ionescu. And in Jordan Brand, growth in performance footwear outpaced retro footwear, as the Tatum and Luka franchises continue to connect with consumers. We also remain confident in growth opportunities like Running. This year we launched the Invincible 3,
which uses the most ZoomX foam of any of our road running shoes for maximum cushioning and comfort.
The Invincible 3 and its clean design demonstrates our intention to not just innovate for performance but to
drive the lifestyle of running as well. The Vomero 5, which doubles down on that intersection of running and
streetwear, became a staple of modern sneaker culture this year.
We continue to deepen the connection with consumers, giving them what they want, where they want it and
how they want it. Our membership offense allows us to know our consumers better and to serve them better.
Today, our members now engage with us more frequently, buy more and are more loyal to our brands.
In the end, as we look ahead of FY24, I’m confident and excited. We are executing our strategy, we have
strong momentum and our teams around the world are united by our winning culture. We remain focused
on extending our leadership position and driving long-term growth. The potential we feel motivates us, and
we’re eager to show what we can do next.

94,Best Buy,Specialty Retailers: Other,"71,100",46298,17066,1419,3.1,BBY,"Dear fellow shareholders, Fiscal year 2023 brought continued uncertainty to
our business and customers, following two years
of record demand and a global pandemic.
I am proud to report that Best Buy navigated these
obstacles by doing what we do best: focusing
on our customers, investing in our strengths, and
planning a definitive course for the future.
We quickly pivoted operations during another
complex year overshadowed by macroeconomic
headwinds. We faced the challenges head on
using the same approach that has served us well
in recent years: Balancing our near-term response
to current conditions and managing what is in our
control, while advancing our strategic initiatives
and investing in areas critical to our long-term
growth.
Before I proceed further, let me take this
opportunity to thank our amazing employees for
the dedication and resilience they continue to
show in this ever-changing environment. Every
day, our management team and employees
across the company make difficult trade-off
decisions while providing amazing customer
experiences. Through all this uncertainty, I am
so proud of the way our team has always kept
our customers as our top priority. It’s because of
the tireless work of this team that Best Buy can
continue to evolve and grow into an even more
vibrant company.
I believe this commitment is driven by our
shared connection to our company purpose — a
purpose that is more relevant today than ever: to
enrich lives through technology.
From a financial results standpoint, we finished
FY23 slightly better than the updated expectations
we provided midway through the year as the
environment evolved. We returned $1.8 billion
to shareholders through share repurchases and
dividends. We increased our quarterly dividend
to $0.92 per share, which represents the tenth
consecutive year of regular quarterly dividend
increases.
I am also excited to share that we reached our
target of achieving $1 billion in annualized cost
reductions during FY23, two years ahead of the
goal we set in 2019. We continue to use these
cost savings to make strategic investments and
navigate other pressures that affect our business.
We began FY23 with an investor update outlining
Best Buy’s path forward. In that update, we shared
three reasons why we believe our strategy is the
right one to deliver growth and long-term value for
all our stakeholders.
1. Technology is a necessity, and we are the only
national tech solutions provider for the home.
2. We have built a unique ecosystem of
customer-centric assets, delivering
experiences that no one else can.
3. Our differentiated abilities and ongoing
investments in our business are designed to
lead to compelling financial returns over time. These three points remain truer today than
ever before. While we are preparing for another
challenging year for the industry as a whole, we
also believe that this calendar year will be the
bottom of the decline in tech demand.
With this in mind, on behalf of my leadership team,
let me state clearly that we are optimistic about the
future, in part because of the following reasons:
1. Households have twice as many connected
devices as they did before the pandemic.
(Deloitte. “Mastering the New Digital Life: 2022
Connectivity and Mobile Trends, 3rd Edition”)
2. Tech is increasingly viewed more as a
functional need versus an emotional want.
3. Upgrade and replacement cycles in the
Consumer Electronics category are historically
three to seven years, so many of those recently
purchased devices will likely be eligible for an
upgrade soon.
4. Innovation is normalizing after having been
largely paused since the beginning of the
pandemic. This will likely take shape in two
ways: Stimulating upgrades/replacements and
creating new categories.
5. Structural innovations (like cloud, augmented
reality, broadband infrastructure funding, and
the electrification of our homes and vehicles)
will continue to drive demand.
These factors align well with our vision to
humanize and personalize technology for every
stage of life. We continue our own expansion
into newer categories, like wellness and electric
transportation, and our employees provide the
advice our customers need to make the best
decision for their needs. We are the technology
experts and remain the best place for people
to see and try the latest products and get tech
support, even in their own homes.
We intend not only to maintain that reputation but
also to build on it. In keeping with our approach
to manage today while investing for tomorrow,
we are focused on five strategic areas in FY24.
• Building customer relationships through
membership. We will continue to evolve our
offerings to create long-lasting connections
with customers that align with their wants
and needs. Millions of customers belong to
our My Best Buy and Totaltech programs,
and we are seeing increased engagement,
higher spending with us and more crosscategory buying than from nonmembers.
• Evolving our omnichannel retail model.
Over the past three years, we have seen our
digital sales increase significantly, and they
now make up one-third of our total domestic
sales. At the same time, our stores remain
a cornerstone asset. Based on successful
pilots in several markets, we are rolling out
a new approach to our stores and staffing.
We are moving away from a “one-size-fitsall” model to serving defined geographic
areas with the right mix of store formats
and fulfillment solutions that best serve the
customers who live there.
• Incubating and growing Best Buy Health.
We’re building on our early successes in
this space by leveraging our unique assets,
including the Geek Squad, to enable care
at home for everyone throughout their
health journey. Partnerships with some
of the nation’s largest health systems are
accelerating our footprint in the market.
• Unlocking reverse secondary market
opportunities. By refurbishing and reselling
non-new inventory, we believe Best Buy will
be able to create new revenue streams and
appeal to a larger customer base. This also
aligns with our priority of contributing to a
circular economy, a system that promotes
using fewer new natural resources, keeping
products and materials in use as long
as possible, and finding alternatives to
throwing them away.
• Removing cost and improving efficiency
and effectiveness. As mentioned earlier,
driving profitability across our business and
eliminating unnecessary spending allows us
to make investments to fuel our future.
As you can see, we are investing despite these
turbulent times. Our investments build on our
one-of-a-kind suite of capabilities that allows
us to create customer experiences no one else
can. In fact, our customer satisfaction scores tell
us that we delivered better experiences across
many areas this past holiday season than last
year and the pre-pandemic fourth quarter of
FY20, especially within our services and delivery
experiences. All of this work continues our proven
track record of managing through challenges to
become a stronger company on the other side.
To be clear, it’s Best Buy’s culture and incredible
teams of employees that make this possible and
make us confident in our future.
We know our employees and the expert
service they provide are our core competitive
differentiator, and we remain focused on being a
best place to work. I am proud that our employee
retention rates continue to outperform the retail
industry and remain low, especially in crucial areas
like store general managers.
Competitive compensation continues to be
critical to attracting and retaining top talent, and
we have increased our store associate hourly pay
by approximately 25% in the last three years. We
also provide training and opportunities for our
employees to upskill and reskill so they can work
more flexibly and pick the career path best for
them at Best Buy. I am also incredibly proud that
60% of our general managers started their Best
Buy careers in non-leadership roles, and 94% of
our general managers and assistant managers
here today were hired internally.
From a community standpoint, we celebrated
a milestone this year: the Best Buy Foundation
saw the opening of its 52nd Best Buy Teen Tech
Center®. That puts the foundation more than
halfway to its goal of building 100 locations
across the United States by 2025. These centers
continue to provide young people with the access,
inspiration and opportunity they deserve to help
them define their futures. And we know they work:
On average, 95% of Teen Tech Center members
plan to continue their education after high school,
and 71% have an increased interest in studying
STEM fields (Science, Technology, Engineering
and Math).
I am proud to say that Best Buy continues to be
recognized for the many ways we are supporting
our employees and communities. We ranked
34th, and were the No. 1 retailer, on the JUST
Capital list that evaluates and ranks the largest
publicly traded companies in the U.S., in part, on
how a company invests in its workers, supports
its communities and minimizes environmental
impact. And for the eighth time, we were named
to the Ethisphere World’s Most Ethical Companies
list, which recognizes companies based on
culture, environmental and social practices, ethics
and compliance activities, and diversity initiatives.
We were one of only three retailers on the list of
136 companies from 22 countries. (Click here
to view our FY22 ESG Report. We publish a new
report every summer and have been doing so
since 2006.)
I would like to conclude by expressing my deepest
gratitude to my colleagues across Best Buy. Your
enthusiasm for the work we do, the celebration of
our culture and the commitment to our customers
is truly amazing. To our shareholders, please
accept my heartfelt thank you for the confidence
and support you continue to show.
Respectfully,",
95,Bristol-Myers Squibb,Pharmaceuticals,"34,300",46159,145780,6327,13.7,BMY,"2022 was an important year for our company, one with significant clinical and regulatory achievements that broadened our portfolio, advanced our pipeline and, importantly, delivered innovative new medicines to our patients. Despite navigating a persistent global pandemic and ongoing macro and geopolitical challenges, our employees’ dedication to our vision of transforming patients’ lives through science never wavered. Our commitment to executing against our business strategy resulted in strong operational and financial performance in 2022. Total revenues were $46.2 billion, which is consistent with the prior year, or an increase of three percent1 when adjusted for foreign exchange, generating GAAP EPS of $2.95 and non-GAAP EPS2 of $7.70. Our in-line brands and new product portfolio performed well growing nine percent for the full year, or 13 percent when adjusting for foreign exchange, with new products delivering $2.0 billion in revenues. Bringing Transformational Medicines to Patients In 2022, we launched three, new first-in-class medicines: Opdualag® for metastatic melanoma, Camzyos® for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and SotyktuTM for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. All three of these
medicines have the opportunity to change the standard
of care for their respective diseases. We also expanded the
potential of our new product portfolio through significant
clinical milestones throughout the course of the year. We
achieved positive top-line results for Reblozyl® in first-line
myelodysplastic syndromes and Abecma® in the KarMMa-3
trial, which demonstrated superiority to standard regimens
in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. Registrational
trials were also initiated for Sotyktu in systemic lupus
erythematosus, a disease with very high unmet medical
need. We also made meaningful investments in our cell
therapy franchise to expand manufacturing capacity and
supply more product to patients.
We continued to enhance our strong internal research
and development capabilities with an extensive network
of external collaborations. These include new strategic
partnerships with Century and Immatics as well as the
acquisition of Turning Point Therapeutics, which expanded
our precision oncology portfolio. We augmented our
existing artificial intelligence capabilities through a
partnership with Owkin to further aid in the acceleration
of drug design and development. Advancing Multiple Paths for Sustained Growth
As a company, we must constantly evolve our business,
so we deliver sustained value to our patients, employees,
business partners and shareholders.
Bristol Myers Squibb is well positioned for the future, with
multiple paths to growth through the second half of the
decade. Ahead of the losses of exclusivity that are scheduled
to take place this decade, we have made significant progress
toward renewing and transforming our product portfolio.
This includes successfully building critical mass across our
four core therapeutic areas and diversifying and broadening
our pipeline.
Central to our strategy is the potential of our new product
portfolio. Over the past three years, we have launched nine
new medicines, many of which are either best-in-class or
first-in-class medicines that have meaningful potential to
expand into additional indications. Our pipeline execution
and strong commercial momentum position us well to
achieve $10 billion to $13 billion of risk-adjusted revenue
in 2025 from this portfolio. As a result of our pipeline
advancement, we have significantly de-risked the more
than $25 billion of long-term, non-risk-adjusted revenue
potential in 2030 from our new products.3
Our second wave of innovation will be bolstered by our
exciting mid- and late-stage pipeline. We have six assets
in or moving into Phase 3 clinical development across our
core therapeutic areas, with expected non-risk-adjusted
peak sales potential of greater than $10 billion.3
 The assets
include milvexian, a next generation anti-thrombotic,
our CELMoD agents for multiple myeloma and LPA-1
in lung fibrosis.
Our research teams have built a robust early-stage pipeline,
consisting of 50+ assets, with more than 15-20 of these
assets expected to progress to proof of concept within
the next 18 months. We continue to leverage our financial
flexibility to enhance our internal innovation through our
disciplined business development strategy. Together, this has
resulted in a much younger, more diversified and resilient
product portfolio, which will be instrumental in helping
navigate an increasingly complex environment in the
United States and abroad.
Living Our Values in the Communities We Serve
As a purpose-driven company and a leader in our industry,
Bristol Myers Squibb recognizes our responsibility to
benefit the communities we serve. During 2022, we further
deepened our commitment to our environmental, social
and governance (ESG) principles.
We are collectively working to accelerate innovation,
enhance patient access to innovative medicines, build
an inclusive, diverse and equitable work environment,
and to strengthen our environmental sustainability—
all while operating with the highest levels of quality,
integrity and ethics.
Bristol Myers Squibb continued to make progress in 2022
across our commitments to health equity and inclusion and
diversity (I&D). We exceeded the target set to locate more
than 25 percent of our clinical trials in highly diverse regions
in the U.S., with more than 58 percent of our clinical trial
sites now located in highly diverse U.S. communities. Our
efforts were recognized with a Gold Badge rating on the
Bioethics International Scorecard on clinical trial diversity.
We believe that increasing diversity during discovery and
development is a scientific imperative that will help lead
to better science and better patient outcomes.
The foundation of our success centers around an inclusive
culture that is rooted in diversity of thought, experience
and background. In 2022, we increased the number of
global executives who are women to 48.7% and in the U.S.,
our Black/African American and Latino/Hispanic executives
increased to 6.1% and 6.1%, respectively. Since announcing
our $1 billion Supplier Diversity commitment in 2020,
I am pleased to say that we achieved our goal well
ahead of the 2025 target date.
As a science-driven company, we understand that human
health is inextricably linked to the health of the planet.
We consider environmental responsibility as an imperative
for doing business and expanding health equity around
the world.
Strongly Positioned to Deliver Long-Term Value
Our accomplishments in 2022 reflect our ongoing progress
towards transforming our business. We are very well
positioned to advance the commercialization of our new
product portfolio, progress our pipeline and invest in future
sources of growth due to our strong financial foundation.
Looking ahead, I am very optimistic about the future of
our business. This is due to our talented workforce, with their
dedication and proven ability to discover, develop and deliver
transformational medicines. Our employees’ passion and
commitment to our mission will help us execute against
our long-term strategy, deliver value to our shareholders
and bring new scientific breakthroughs to patients
around the world.",
96,United Airlines Holdings,Airlines,"92,795",44955,14474,737,1.6,UAL,"Dear Fellow United Stockholders, On behalf of the United Airlines Holdings, Inc.’s Board of Directors, it is my pleasure to invite you to attend our 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which is scheduled to be held on Wednesday, May 24, 2023 at 9:00 a.m. Central Time. It is a privilege to serve as the Chairman of the Board and to work closely with our CEO, Scott Kirby, and my fellow Board members as we execute our fiduciary responsibilities to you, our stockholders. The Board could not be prouder of how Scott and his team navigated the Company through the most challenging period in its history. The Board supported the Company’s investments in our tools, infrastructure and people as well as the other unique steps that the Company took during the last three years to prepare for the Company’s recovery. Despite our challenges, the Company achieved a remarkable number of successes that Scott discusses in his letter, which could not have been done without the hard work and dedication of our employees around the globe. Amidst the turbulent global environment, the Board continues to remain committed to oversight of the Company’s strategy, including management’s execution of our United Next plan. The Company announced the next chapter of its United Next plan when it unveiled in December 2022 its order to purchase up to 200 new Boeing widebody planes. The order was the biggest single order for widebody jets ever placed by a U.S. airline and is expected to support our fleet renewal and expansion plans through the next decade. The Board has also worked with Scott and the senior management team to further integrate our environmental, social, and governance approach into United’s corporate strategy, including by staying engaged on United’s ESG priorities, reporting, risks and opportunities. We are proud that United has invested in more sustainable aviation fuel production than any other airline in the world, based on publicly announced airline offtake agreements for future SAF purchases. We believe that the increased use of SAF by airlines will aid with the volatility in the fuel market as well as help enable a degree of energy security for the United States and airlines. I encourage you to review our Corporate Responsibility Report to learn more about our ESG goals, targets, commitments, strategies and initiatives. A key component to our effective governance is the Board’s commitment to provide not only oversight but also perspectives reflecting a diversity of independent view. We are continuously focused on ensuring that the Board is composed of directors with the broad experience, attributes, balance of professional skills and diversity of perspectives to oversee the success of the business. In January 2023, the Board welcomed Captain Garth Thompson, who was appointed to the Board by the United Airlines Pilots Master Executive Council of the Air Line Pilots Association, International following Captain Michael Hamilton’s departure from the Board in December 2022. We would like to take this opportunity to thank Captain Hamilton for his service to the Company and its stakeholders. We also place a high priority on communicating with our investors. Over the past year, we developed a robust stockholder engagement program and discussed with stakeholders our business strategy and priorities as well as our ESG strategy, among other topics. On behalf of the Board, I and certain other Board members joined members of management in several of these stockholder engagement meetings. The feedback we gathered from these engagements has been helpful as the Board considers changes and updates to our policies, practices and disclosures. We look forward to continuing our dialogue with you. Lastly, I join our entire Board in thanking you for your interest and continued confidence in United and the opportunity to serve United as directors on your behalf. We hope you will participate in the Annual Meeting by attending virtually and ask for your support for our directors and other items described in this Proxy Statement by voting, as promptly as possible, through one of the options laid out in the Proxy Statement whether or not you plan to join us for the Annual Meeting. Your participation is important, so please exercise your right to vote. We hope that you and your families will have an opportunity, whether for business or pleasure, to travel with us in 2023.

shareholders,
customers and
colleagues
As I reflect on 2022, I am proud of what we achieved.
Our team’s incredible dedication to our customers
and our Mission enabled us to successfully navigate a
dynamic environment, exceed our goals and deliver value
for all of our stakeholders. I would like to thank our more
than 125,000 colleagues, whose passion for enabling our
customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer
fuels our success. And thank you to our customers and
shareholders for your continued confidence in us as a
partner in building a brighter future for all.
We measure our success in a number of ways – not only
by our financial results, but also by being the strongest
partner for our customers, by providing an excellent work
experience for our colleagues, by creating value for our
shareholders and by making a positive impact on society.
By all of these measures, it was another exceptional year
for Thermo Fisher Scientific.
Outstanding financial results
Starting with our financials, we continued our
long track record of outstanding performance.
In 2022, we grew our revenue by 15 percent to
$44.92 billion, delivered strong earnings results
consisting of GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS)
of $17.63 and adjusted EPS¹ of $23.24, and we
generated very strong free cash flow¹ of $6.94 billion.
We also returned significant capital to our
shareholders through $3.5 billion of stock
buybacks and dividends.
Our continued success is propelled by our proven
growth strategy, which consists of three pillars:
• Developing high-impact, innovative new products
• Leveraging our scale in high-growth and emerging
markets
• Delivering a unique value proposition to our customers
We continued to execute this strategy during 2022,
and the investments we’ve made are driving growth
and generating strong returns. I’ll review our progress
within the three pillars.
Commitment to high-impact innovation
Beginning with the first pillar, our focus on highimpact innovation enables our customers to address
some of the world’s greatest challenges, and in
2022, we invested $1.5 billion in R&D to deliver new technologies across our businesses that are helping
our customers achieve their goals. There are so
many great examples from the year, and I’ll highlight
just a few.
In chromatography and mass spectrometry, we
extended our industry-leading Thermo Scientific
Orbitrap portfolio, launching the Orbitrap Ascend
Tribrid mass spectrometer to advance proteomics,
metabolomics and cancer biomarker research. We
also launched the Thermo Scientific TRACE 1600
Series Gas Chromatograph to increase productivity
in analytical testing for food, environmental,
industrial and pharmaceutical applications. In
electron microscopy, we launched the Thermo
Scientific Glacios 2 Cryo-TEM (transmission electron
microscope) to help our customers accelerate
structure-based drug discovery for debilitating
disorders such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and
Huntington’s diseases, as well as research for cancer
and gene mutations. In bioproduction, we launched
the Gibco CTS DynaCellect Magnetic Separation
System to support cell and gene therapy programs.
It was truly a spectacular year of innovation, and we
have an exciting pipeline of new products that will be
launched in 2023 and beyond.
Leveraging our scale
The second pillar of our growth strategy is leveraging
our scale in high-growth and emerging markets to
create a differentiated experience for our customers.
During the year, we continued to strengthen our
capabilities serving these markets.
To support customers in China and the Asia-Pacific
region, we opened a new biologics manufacturing
facility in Hangzhou, China, which provides
integrated clinical and commercial drug substance
and drug product capabilities. We also opened a
new Bioprocess Supply Center in Incheon, South
Korea, to provide customers with key materials for
production of their biopharmaceuticals, while also
expanding our clinical trial services there.
Our scale and expanding capabilities in these
regions will create growth opportunities for us well
into the future. Creating value for our customers
Our third pillar is delivering a unique value proposition
for our customers, and we continue to strengthen our
capabilities to serve them.
During 2022, we executed on the accelerated
investments we’ve made over the last three years,
bringing new capacity online for pharma services,
bioproduction and clinical research services.
In pharma services, we opened a manufacturing
facility in Plainville, Massachusetts, for the
development, testing and production of viral vectors
used in cell and gene therapies.
In bioproduction, we brought new capacity online in
Lebanon, Tennessee, and Millersburg, Pennsylvania,
for single-use technologies used in the production of
biologic drugs. We added cell-culture manufacturing
capacity in Grand Island, New York, and opened a
facility in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, where we’ll
make resin beads used in the production of vaccines
and breakthrough treatments for rheumatoid arthritis,
multiple sclerosis, asthma and other diseases.
We also integrated new capabilities that we’ve
added through M&A, including recombinant proteins
to complement our biosciences offering from the
acquisition of PeproTech, which we completed at the
close of 2021. In addition, our integration of PPD, which we acquired
in 2021, has been very successful and is largely
complete. PPD forms our clinical research business
and is performing extremely well as our customers
realize the benefits of our combined offering to help
them bring new drugs and therapies to patients.
We are winning significant new business in clinical
research services and have raised our revenue
synergy expectations for the business.
Given the strong growth outlook, during the year we
opened a new state-of-the-art bioanalytical lab at our
clinical research campus in Richmond, Virginia, to
support increasing demand for analytical services to
accelerate drug development.
As always, our Practical Process Improvement
(PPI) Business System and our Mission-driven
culture were major factors in our success. In a
year marked by global supply-chain disruptions, a
war in Ukraine, COVID-19 lockdowns in China and
inflationary headwinds, PPI enabled us to engage
and empower our colleagues around the world to
find a better way every day to overcome challenges,
improve processes and work more efficiently and
effectively. This had a significant impact on our ability
to meet our customers’ needs, maximize return on
investments, drive growth and fulfill our Mission –
enabling us to deliver differentiated performance for
our stakeholders.
Making a positive impact on society
As a Mission-driven company, we help to make the
world a better place by enabling our customers’
success. We also make a difference by supporting
our communities and being a good steward of our
planet, and I’m proud of the actions we took in 2022.
During the year, we continued to advance our
environmental sustainability roadmap, reducing our
carbon footprint and finalizing significant power
purchasing agreements to accelerate our transition
toward 100% renewable energy. We also increased
our 2030 greenhouse gas emissions reduction
target for our operations to achieve a 50% reduction
in this decade.
Through our Foundation for Science, we supported
students across the globe with our STEM education
programs, including becoming the title sponsor of the
Thermo Fisher Scientific Junior Innovators Challenge,
the premier middle school STEM competition in the
United States.
I also want to thank our local colleague-led
Community Action Councils and all of our team
members who collectively volunteered more than
120,000 hours during 2022 to advance STEM
education and support their communities. n addition, we achieved our goal, a year ahead
of plan, to hire 500 graduates from historically
Black colleges and universities. This supports our
commitment to diversity and inclusion within our
company and to increasing opportunities for all.
Enhancing our vibrant culture
We accomplished so much in 2022, and none
of it would be possible without the passion and
commitment of our incredible global team. That’s why
we continue to build a vibrant and inclusive culture,
where our colleagues are inspired to bring their best
every day and know they can achieve their career
aspirations within our company.
Throughout the year, Thermo Fisher was recognized
for our industry leadership and our inclusive culture.
We earned a 100% score on the Human Rights
Campaign’s 2022 Corporate Equality Index for
LGBTQ equality for the seventh consecutive year
and advanced on Fortune’s list of the World’s Most
Admired Companies. We were also recognized by
Forbes magazine as one of the World’s Top
Female-Friendly Companies and one of America’s
Best Employers for Veterans.
This is an ongoing journey, and we’ll continually
strive to make Thermo Fisher the best place for our
colleagues to have a Mission-driven career.
Looking ahead
In so many ways, 2022 was another special year for
our company, and I’m very excited about what lies
before us.
Thermo Fisher is uniquely positioned to help our
customers navigate the year ahead. We have an
experienced management team leading the most
talented colleagues in the industry, the power of our
PPI Business System to make us even stronger, and a
profound Mission that fuels our success.
On behalf of our global team, thank you once again
for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. I look
forward to what we will accomplish together in 2023
and beyond.

Our response and performance have been true to both our legacy of achievement and our commitment to the future. As we emerge from the pandemic, we are ready to lead in the dynamic new era of healthcare that lies ahead. CHALLENGE AND OPPORTUNITY
With its breadth and impact on all aspects of society,
Covid has been the most significant global health crisis in
a century. When the world needed help as this new virus
ground it to a halt, Abbott answered the call. We quickly
formed a battery of R&D and operational teams to attack
the new virus from multiple angles.
The result: more than a dozen different tests for use at all
stages of the disease process and in a wide range of testing
styles and environments, from hospital laboratories to
self-testing.
The availability of fast, accurate, and accessible testing
was a major factor in the world’s response to the
pandemic. It gave people confidence that they could
conduct their lives safely and allowed them to regain
normalcy after the disruptions of the virus.
The success of our actions also built major new businesses
for Abbott at unprecedented speed and, importantly for
the long term, demonstrated the power and potential of
rapid diagnostics. We showed the world the many benefits
of testing — and of health technology broadly — that is
decentralized, digitized, and democratized. This greatly
accelerated the adoption of the technology and built
strong new channels to pharmacies, to doctors’ offices,
and to people’s homes.
So, while Covid testing will become a smaller part of
our business as we move from a pandemic to an endemic
level, Abbott has built a leading position for the promising
future of rapid testing.
And this is not the only long-term opportunity that the
success of our pandemic response made possible for us.
Over this period, our Covid-testing revenues allowed us to
invest an additional $2 billion to fund or accelerate R&D
programs and marketing efforts in our priority growth
areas. We also invested approximately $6 billion in capital
projects that will expand our manufacturing capacity and
improve our capabilities.
As a result of these strategic moves and investments,
Abbott is an even stronger company coming out of Covid
than we were going into it.
The pandemic has, of course, had many other impacts on
our operating environment and our business. It’s affected
our institutional customers by reducing their ability to
perform hospital procedures and routine testing. And it’s
disrupted global supply chains and work patterns, both of
which have contributed to inflation.
Abbott has dealt with challenges like these time and again
over its long history. While Covid whipped them together
into a unique storm, we’ve weathered many. Abbott is a
long-term company; we know how to plan, how to adapt,
how to find the ways we need to deliver for both our
customers and our shareholders.
That’s how, over the three years of the pandemic, we
not only returned a total of nearly $15 billion to
shareholders through dividends and share repurchases,
but, at the same time, continued to invest for our durable,
long-term growth.
Significant as today’s challenges are, you can rely on
Abbott to persevere, to perform, and to live up to our
values as we always have.
An example was our voluntary recall of infant formula
and temporary suspension of manufacturing at one of our U.S. plants. We addressed this situation and resumed
production in July. With adjustments to our global
manufacturing network — running our U.S. facilities
at increased capacity and importing additional formula
from Europe — we were able to deliver roughly the same
volume of formula in the U.S. in the second half of 2022
as we did prior to the stoppage. As a result, availability on
store shelves is improving and we will continue working
to get families the consistent and dependable supply of
high-quality infant formula they’ve relied on for almost
a century.
While managing the demands of the present, we’ve kept
our eyes on the future and its opportunities, which we
believe have never been greater.
Medical science is advancing at high speed, with
significant progress in miniaturization, and greater
understanding of gene expression and the microbiome.
Data technology is doing the same, with new capabilities
from artificial intelligence to machine learning to
advanced manufacturing. And the two fields are
combining to create remarkable new possibilities.
New connected technologies allow patients to receive
care from their physicians whenever and wherever they
need it. Wearable digital sensing technologies give people
the information about their bodies that they need to
manage medical conditions or monitor and improve their
health. New diagnostic platforms are transforming the
ways testing is conducted from the lab to the home. We’re
in the midst of a new healthcare revolution, and Abbott is
among its foremost leaders.
In 2022 alone, we delivered a host of innovative new
product approvals and launches, including:
• FreeStyle Libre 3, the world’s smallest, most accurate
continuous glucose monitoring sensor
• The EnSite X EP System, our new cardiac mapping
platform, which helps physicians better treat abnormal
heart rhythms
• Aveir, our single-chamber leadless pacemaker for the
treatment of patients with slow heart rhythms
• An upgraded version of our NeuroSphere myPath digital
health app with enhanced functionality
• Our Proclaim Plus spinal cord stimulation system
featuring the next generation of Abbott’s proprietary
BurstDR therapy
• And two new Amplatzer cardiac devices: Amulet, which
helps reduce the risk of stroke in people with atrial
fibrillation; and Talisman, to treat people with a small
opening between the upper chambers of the heart that
puts them at risk of recurrent ischemic stroke
And our pipeline for the future remains very rich.
We have the technologies and opportunities we need
to fuel both therapeutic advancement and robust
growth for years to come. These technologies and
their life-changing impact for patients and consumers
can be seen throughout this report.
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Despite the headwinds in our operating environment,
Abbott delivered sales of $43.7 billion in 2022 — an
increase of around 6.4 percent on an organic basis2
 —
and earnings-per-share of $5.343
, exceeding our initial
forecast for the year. In December, we announced a dividend increase of
8.5 percent for 2023; this makes for an average annual
dividend increase of more than 12 percent since the
beginning of the pandemic. Abbott has now paid
dividends for 99 consecutive years and is in the exclusive
ranks of Dividend Kings, the small group of companies
that have increased dividends for more than 50 years
in a row.
Over the past three years, Abbott has provided
shareholders a total return of approximately 32.5
percent, versus a market return of 23.6 percent.
The key to that success in an environment like today’s is
our diversified business strategy, which gives us defensive
strength by protecting us from market downturns in
particular businesses, and offensive strength by providing
us more ways to compete and win.
THE FUTURE
The challenges of the last three years demonstrate
precisely why and how Abbott will continue to lead far
into the future. Our company has thrived for 135 years
because of its resilience and adaptability, its diversified
portfolio of leading businesses, its financial strength
and acumen, and a deep-rooted culture of service,
execution, and success.
Because of our extensive history and experience, Abbott
takes the long view. While our experience helps us
navigate the waters of the present, it also ensures that we
always steer toward the horizon. We’re inspired by the
immense potential of the future of healthcare and believe
that we are very well positioned to capture it.
Our objective, laid out in our 2030 Sustainability Plan,
is to help three billion people every year with Abbott
products — a fifty percent increase over the course of the
plan. To achieve that ambitious goal, we’re working to
transform the future of healthcare. We’ve adopted a set of
guiding innovation principles with the explicit intention
of making our technologies more accessible to more
people. That means easier to use. It means deliverable in
new ways. And it means reducing the total cost of care to
help patients, providers, and payers.
We’re energized by that vision and believe there’s never
been a better time to be in healthcare. We’re here at
Abbott to help people live fuller lives through better
health. That’s a high purpose and a responsibility that
we take very seriously. To us, it means the motivation to
create the life-changing products and technologies of
the future, the vigilance to ensure they’re of the highest
quality, and the commitment to meet the needs of the
people we’re here to serve.

We have remained true to that purpose for 137 years, and I am as encouraged today about the future of our business as I have ever been. Our strategy is clear. It’s centered around people— our consumers and employees—and driving sustainable solutions that build resilience into our business to respond to current and future challenges, while creating positive change for the planet. GREAT BRANDS, BOLD EXPERIMENTATION As a total beverage company, we are committed to offering people more of the drinks they want across a range of categories and in a variety of sizes. In 2022, we launched 246 low- or no-sugar beverages and continued to see doubledigit growth for Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, which is now available in more than 170 markets. This helped to drive our volume of low- and no-calorie beverage sales to 29% of total volume. We’re driving the most significant marketing transformation in our history, focused on digital-first engagement with consumers. We’re combining partnerships, technology and our consumers’ passions to create unforgettable experiences in music, gaming and sports, including: •  Coca-Cola Creations: This global innovation platform lends the iconic Coca-Cola brand to new expressions, driven by collaboration, creativity and cultural connection. Launched in 2022, we introduced five limited-edition drinks that drew inspiration from music, gaming and culture. These were complemented with experimental packaging designs and various digital experiences. • Sprite Limelight: A music and cultural extension of the brand’s global platform “Heat Happens,” Sprite Limelight aims to unite fans from different cultures and lifestyles by bringing together different artists from around the world. We’re also experimenting with new drinks. We’ve launched Jack Daniel’s & Coca-Cola as a ready-to-drink cocktail through a relationship with Brown-Forman. This is one example of our ongoing journey to bring Coke to consumers in new and dynamic ways. We take the new responsibilities that come with our entry in this space very seriously. As a result, we’ve embedded our Global Policy on Alcohol Responsibility into our business processes to ensure we grow our alcohol brands in a responsible and sustainable way. SUSTAINABILITY IS CORE TO OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY Water: Water is a priority for our company because it is the first ingredient in all our beverages and is essential to the communities we serve. As a local business operating in more than 200 countries and territories, we have a responsibility to help protect critical resources. Our 2030 Water Security Strategy focuses on increasing water security. We work with partners to provide access to a steady supply of clean water for people and ecosystems in the areas where we operate and source ingredients. We recently announced a more focused effort to prioritize the most waterstressed regions. As we’ve done since 2015, we’ll continue to replenish the water we use in our finished beverages to nature and communities. In 2022, we replenished 159%. Packaging: We seek to drive a circular economy for our
packaging because this helps to reduce waste and carbon
emissions. We’re working to use more recycled content in
our packaging, to expand our use of refillable bottles, and to
collect packaging for recycling through our World Without
Waste initiative. We also partner to design new solutions for
packaging. For example, we licensed our technology for a 100%
plant-based plastic bottle to a company building a commercialscale facility in Germany. This bio-based plastic packaging
has a lower carbon footprint than other plastics. While we’re
making progress, we know there is more work to be done.
In 2022, we collected 61% of the equivalent bottles and cans
that we introduced into the market and used 15% rPET
in our bottles.
To galvanize collective action, we invest in solutions and
partnerships across industry, governments and society.
In 2022, we became a Strategic Partner of the Ellen MacArthur
Foundation. This group includes companies within key industry
sectors that can help drive the transition to a circular economy.
Climate: Our water, packaging and climate goals are
interconnected. For example, by creating a circular economy
for packaging, we can lower our carbon footprint.
By approaching water stewardship from a basin perspective,
we participate in initiatives that increase communities’
resilience to extreme weather events, alongside our partners.
Our approach to climate is rooted in science, and we’ve
set a science-based target to reduce absolute greenhouse
gas emissions by 25% by 2030, against a 2015 baseline.
As of 2022, we have reduced our emissions by 7% against
this baseline.
A COMPANY FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS
We’re committed to creating a culture of inclusion and
belonging and to driving meaningful change in our
communities. By 2030, we aspire to be 50% led by women
globally. Today, 39% of our senior leaders are women.
The Coca-Cola Foundation, the philanthropic arm of
The Coca-Cola Company, contributed $94.8 million to 301
organizations around the world in 2022 to help create a better
shared future for the communities our business serves.
Our continued success would not be possible without our
people. I am grateful for the company and system employees
who live our purpose every day. Their collective passion
and focus to build loved brands and make a difference in
the world is how our business will continue to thrive for
generations to come.",
